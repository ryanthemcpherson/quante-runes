- Definitely want to try to fight Illaoi hard level 1, and pre-6 in general. She becomes impossible to kill post-6 with her R
- Get behind her and look to fight. Try to fight outside of tentacle range, Illaoi W start + tentacles nearby can actually trade with Urgot level 1
- You should get prio. If you don't manage to fight until minions arrive, respect her Q range, or if she isn't Qing be ready to E her W if she W's at you 

HOW TO TRADE
- Illaoi E is the main ability you have to play around. If it's up, especially post-6, you cannot go aggro
   - You can look to trade as hard as you want if she misses it, this is your main window
   - If she hits it, try to exit the tether range ASAP to avoid damage. 
- Always stand behind minions, and try to Q + PTA/Leg trade when she CSes. 
   - You have to be respectful of her Q as well though, have good spacing and don't let her slap you for free
- Illaoi loves to try to hump you under tower, fishing for Es/Qs. This is the only window where you can look to kill Illaoi with E + Flash + R, as she self stuns with her ability animations, and it's easy for her to get tower aggro
- You can kill pre-6 with Ignite, but after 6 it's entirely Illaoi favored

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Illaoi's ult makes her displacement immune, meaning if well timed she can immune your E flip. If the Illaoi is good, you'll almost always have to look for a E + Flash to kill
- Illaois like to Q/W + tentacle the wave to insta kill your minions, opening you up for a surprise E. Be careful for this
- The tentacles still slap, even if you kill them
- Be careful of calling your jungler to gank Illaoi unless its for sure free, she can easily 2v1.
   - Both of you have to dodge the E if you want to gank

TIPS
- If she has no tentacles when she grabs your E, it won't do anything really. You don't have to exit the tether range and can stand your ground and trade back
- Illaoi is a champ that can only lane, unless you have 5 melee champs. She's useless in teamfights so going even and scaling up is a win for Urgot
- The "scaling" in this matchup is dependent on if you dodge Illaoi E or not, she will always be able to kill if she hits it'

- Look hard to fight Irelia level 1. If you can E her before the minions get low and she can't Q away, you smoke her
- If Irelia doesn't appear until the minions are low, be careful of her dodging your E by QQQ'ing the first 3 minions -> Q you with full passive
   - In this scenario, try to predict your E into her Q on the minions
- If Irelia starts E, try to zone her off the first 3 EXP. If she walks up you fist her

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is determined on how many stacks she has/she can get: 
   - When the wave is pushing into you, show respect pre-9, she has max stacks 
   - When the wave is pushing into her, you have to be careful. Try to walk AHEAD of your wave and fight her so she can't dash around thru your wave
   - MAKE SURE YOUR WAVE CRASHES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK IRELIAS FREEZE 1v1
- If she E->Q's you, E behind yourself, not at her, or it will miss
- HOLD YOUR E UNTIL GUARANTEED. They will always try to bait it out with Q dash. 
- If she wastes W, you can look to play aggressive, they usually use it to setup the minion wave to Q through, so be careful  you don't miss E
- You have to stand your ground and fight with Ignite in this matchup, if she can fight you in your minion wave and win you can't play the game


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very patient with your E, always pay attention if she's trying to bait it with a minion to Q to. 
- Her W gives her damage reduction, so don't ult too early if she negates your E damage with W
- She powerspikes hard on BORK and Plated Steelcaps
- If she gets a freeze on you pre-9, hopefully your jungler comes to help, but if not look to roam or put pressure on the map. YOU CAN'T BREAK IT SOLO

TIPS
- This is a very difficult matchup vs good Irelias, and if you make one mistake they can freeze on you forever. 
   - Really focus on playing aggro first 3 waves, and then respecting afterwards if she doesn't fuck up
- You turbo outscale Irelia, especially in teamfights, as long as you get your EXP you're fine.
- Can rush bramble vest + plated steelcaps yourself if you fall behind, your base damage at 9 can stat check her hard

- You can fight him level 1, just save your E to buffer his E.  
- If you take the brush, Auto -> E -> Space out his E while he's stunned -> Auto Auto PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane pre-9 you always want to play for the freeze. Jax wants the long lane to run you down with max passive stacks
    - Never fight when the wave is pushing into you
    - Jax has a hard time breaking freezes and will eat a lot of damage while being vulnerable to ganks.
    - Very important to look to poke Jax while wave is frozen so when it bounces out you can kill him before he ramps his stacks up
- Very E cooldown-based matchup, whoever E's first loses. Always Buffer your E into his E
    - If you E his E, always click away to not get stunned before Autoing again
- Your Q is also super important, when he jumps on you -> Q under yourself to make space -> Land E
   - Jax's model places him "in" you, so if you E forwards immediately it won't connect
   - Also be careful that he can jump over your Q and then trade
- If he jumps on you with E, buffer it with your E -> Q -> PTA trade and you win. 
   - You can also just E if you can make a tiny bit of space between you guys, usually you have to E backwards/to the side.
- If he jumps on you without using E, Q -> PTA trade, and hold your E
- You can look to all in from 70% HP if you buffer his E, Ignite + R kills him easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Jax's will know you want to Buffer E into his counterstrike (E), and will try to sidestep in their E animation
- When Jax has passive + grasp stacks up, you have to respect. 
- Keep in mind Jax's minions when he walks up with E. They'll try to bait your E, then Q to their minion out of range
- Spacing is super important in this lane, don't let him W + Grasp trade with you for free. 
   - You need an HP advantage pre-9 to trade, or else he can just all in you before you can kill. 
- If he manages to stun you while you flip him, be careful in buffering your R, as he can jump away to dodge it once you're both unstunned

TIPS
- You have kill potential at every point during this lane as long as you're not in the long lane.
- Ignite really helps in this lane as it goes thru his counterstrike (E) 
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver for the rest of the game

- Look to fight Jayce level 1, if you manage to Flip him it makes the lane significantly easier
- Most Jayce's start E or Q, try to push them into the brush and ignite early for vision. 
- If you can Flip/chunk Jayce, level 2 prio -> E + Flash is an easy solokill

HOW TO TRADE
- When facing Jayce:
   - Stay behind minions to dodge his ranged Q
   - Use the brush/respect his auto range to not let him get free autos off
- Just look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades if he enters your range. Use your Q slow to push him off if he's trying to auto you a lot
- If he fucks up his spacing you can even look to Q -> E combo, but be careful of doing this if he's full HP, or you don't have Ult/Ignite. Jayce does a lot of damage if you can't finish him off instantly
- You usually will never have the range to normal E Jayce. Only if he melee Qs into you can you look to E
- Jayce MS gate (ranged E) and knockback (melee E) give him insane self-peel, it's really easy for him to kite you. Missing E/Q can lead to a really bad trade
- With Ignite and early AD items, you one shot Jayce from ~75%HP with E + Flash. Can give CS to avoid taking poke until he's in kill range
   - Because of Jayce's oppressive poke, it's important to look to one-shot before he can slowly poke you down
- When he transforms from Melee -> Ranged, this is a good window to look to all-in as he can't melee E (knockback) for a couple seconds
- You can buffer E into Jayce E, but you have to predict it as it roots you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Jayce's main poke tool is his QE from range, try to walk in random directions when you don't have a minion wave to cover you (like when you're CS'ing under tower)
- Jayce will often look to melee Q your minions, and hit you with the AOE damage. Be respectful of the melee Q radius if you stand too close to your wave
- Jayce has built in mana refund, and sustain with Dblade/biscuits, so his resources are deceptively high

TIPS
- Jayce is a really annoying lane bully, and the better the Jayce the more annoying. I've tried many setups into Jayce like Plated Steepcaps rush + play passive, but I think the best strategy is GIGA AGGRO level 1, and build Dirk/Pickaxe/Long Swords and try to just E + Flash + Ignite instantly. 
   - Cheesing Jayce early is so important, as he has 6 abilities at level 3 and you can no longer trade favorably
   - Playing slow is also just hard vs good Jayces, they can space your Q/E too easily and he has such insane poke
- Playing for level 6 spike (you get an ult, he doesn't) is a good strategy
- You beat Jayce at 9/Black Cleaver and outscale 1v1 and in teamfights the rest of the game'

EARLY GAME
- If Kalista facechecks you in a brush early, you can fight, but generally respect and give her range. Her hop is too OP at kiting level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- It's pretty impossible to trade with Kalista, if she doesn't walk into your E range early game focus on giving cs and PRESERVING HP
- If you can predict Q into her hop, look for a small Q + PTA leg trade
   - This chunk can set her up to be killed at level 2/3 with E + Flash + Ignite
- If she's full HP, just focus on not taking too much poke and hitting Q/Legs when you can, don't overforce trades.
- If you haven't found a lead early game, rush Dirk/AD Items and try to one shot at 6 from ~80%HP with E + Flash + R + Ignite
- Kalista usually perma pushes and is very vulnerable to ganks. If you can't find leads 1v1, just make sure you save Flash for jungle ganks
- Never E at her in front of her, only E + Flash. She's too high range to ever hit a normal E 
    - Very important to not lose Flash as you need it to exist in the lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Care for her Q poke + E resetting on minions to chain slow/auto you poke
- Pay attention to her "hop rythm", if she keeps dashing in one direction look to predict poke with Q where she hops

TIPS
- It's a hard lane, but a very uncommon pick. Only really insane Kalista players can pilot Kalista well enough to make it work.
   - It has to get a lot of kills in lane to be useful later on
   - Kalista top also griefs the enemy draft hard usually
- Kalista gets crippled by CC, so playing around your jungler and trying to make it to teamfights is a very viable strategy

HOW TO TRADE

   - Just stand behind your minions to avoid Q damage
- If she wastes her empowered R ability, or her shield, you can look for a small Q + PTA trade to chunk her. 
- Generally, I don't look to interact much in this matchup. Conserve HP, play for a Dirk/Pickaxe first base
   - Then at 6, I look to E + Flash + Ignite + R  oneshot after she uses R+Q to poke
   - You have to wait for her to use R, if she has R + W it heals too much and can prevent your ult from executing
- Once you get some levels and MS going, you can Q- > E combo her. If you hit Flip you hard win

- It is critical you fight Kayle level 1. Get behind her, Flip her, and try to zone her off the first 3 creeps of EXP
- If you chunked her enough level 1, you can look for a dive on the 2nd/3rd wave as you crash into tower.
   - If not, play to setup a freeze/gank angle as the wave then bounces back into you. 
      - Kayle is so weak at this point in the game that you can just walk behind the wave and zone her/fight her 1v1, denying her even more EXP

HOW TO TRADE
- Denying Kayle pre-6 is really important for how trades play out in this lane post-6
- Always look to Q -> E pre-6 Kayle, but focus on not hitting the wave too much. 
   - You want the wave to be pushing into you so you can deny/zone off EXP and setup ganks, which is more important than the trades
   - If you deny enough EXP, you can freeze the wave when you're 6 to her 5, which is huge
- Once Kayle hits 6, it's much harder to hit Q. Still look for Q + PTA/leg trades if you can, but they're rare, especially if she rushes T2 boots
- You can still E + Flash on Kayle post-6 if you have Ignite + AD items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kayle R can block your R2 pull, and in general they will R as you E + Flash to deny burst
   - If you E + Flash, try to see if she insta ults before immediately W'ing + R. If she does, hold off a bit on your burst until it times out.
- Watch out for Kayle's Q thru the minions, and E poke. The damage from these add up
- T2 boots + max passive stacks (gives MS) + W MS make her extremely fast in lane, don't disrespect and miss your E

TIPS
- If you can't find leads in this lane pre-6, don't overforce until level 9. It feels bad, but Kayle will bully you until you get 9/Black Cleaver, so just focus on going even until that spike again
- Kayle outscales you again around 3 items/level 16, so try to close it out early. Her R is a very powerful tool to deny your R

- If he respects your cheese, you can try to trade autos + Legs + PTA by just E'ing forwards to gapclose
- Should get prio for level 2 if played right

HOW TO TRADE
- The main ability to watch out for is his shuriken (Q). Stand behind minions to dodge it, and look for Q + PTA/Leg trades if he gets in range
   - Only look to Q -> Auto if you can't get hit by his Q. If you can, only Q to poke
   - Generally it's hard to look for Q as his Q outranges yours
- Repeat until he's 65%HP, then you can look to E + Flash + R one shot
   - He has really insane escape tools with his W MS and Stun, so make sure you have lethal on the Flip or he will escape fast 
- RUSH MERC TREADS. With merc treads, if he's slowed by Q, you can Q -> E combo usually even if he gets W speed and still Flip. The tenacity helps a lot too, as it lets you buffer E before you get stunned. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his passive stacks on you (3 = stun), if he can Q -> W -> Stun, he can Q you again as you are stunned, which is too much HP to lose
- His empowered auto + W combo hurts, give CS/respect until he uses the empowered auto to CS
- Kennen is a really OP teamfighter. Try to always mark him, or ward flanks/keep track of his flash, Kennen R + Flash can insta win teamfights

- You can fight Kled early in a small trade, but don't extend. You don't have the damage to kill level 1, and he will get too much free courage if dismounted
- Fight as the minion wave arrives. Look to sidestep his Q and trade Autos
   - If he hits Q, E TO THE SIDE FOR THE SHIELD, and auto with legs/PTA. It's risky to flip forwards INTO HIM level 1, as he can trade autos with you, dismount with Conq stacks, and then get a lot of courage to remount before you can kill.

HOW TO TRADE
- The key to this matchup is not dismounting Kled until your E is up
   - If you start off the trade with E, don't dismount him. Don't auto attack him, just walk away to buy time for your E CD
   - If he's able to start the fight at like 30-40% courage he can almost always remount before you can kill, especially if he has his W up.
   - Once Kled is dismounted, E + Flash + W + Ignite is a guaranteed kill
- When you trade, it's important you don't dismount him without the ability to kill, or else the next fight he will remount and gain way too much HP to ever fight again
- Look to sidestep his Q, then go for Q -> PTA/Leg trades. 
   - Try to also tether at max Q range, that way even if he hits it you can walk away from it before it yoinks you (the yoink does way more damage)
- If he wastes W on a minion, you can look to trade 
- Only look to Flip Mounted Kled in this matchup if he's chunked ~60% HP, that way you can kill with R + Ignite before he remounts
- Try to R him right before he dismounts, as he gets a smaller hitbox + Q dash and is harder to hit with R
- Your E can "ride" Kled Q for a guaranteed flip (as long as he doesn't E away). 
   - This is useful when Kled looks to mounted Q you while in his dismount animation, you can ride the Q with your E -> R -> kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kled has one of the strongest level 3's in the game, be respectful of his E -> Q -> W combo
- A lot of Kled's will not level their W until they need it to remount, don't get baited
- Be careful when you E + Flash + R when he's almost dismounted, he goes invulnerable as he dismounts, so your R can miss
- Dismounted Kled's Q is actually a buffer, good Kled's can try to counterplay your E with this
- If you R Kled as he remounts, his remount invcan deny your R2
- Kled R gives him really strong roams/ganks on mid lane, make sure to ping his location


TIPS
- Your E can buffer his R for a guaranteed flip
- Kled needs kills in lane to be useful, you OMEGA outscale Kled as the game goes on.
- Kled players rely on knowing when to remount better than you do to get kills. Don't play into this, only dismount when you have E -> R combo up for guaranteed execute'

- After he buys Chain Vest/armor, it's unplayable

- Space his Q range and buffer E into his W if he tries to go aggro

- Respect the walls, you can't E into him if his W or E is up

- PLAY AROUND PHASE RUSH, make sure it's up if he R's you

'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,249 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E89: Details='EARLY GAME
- You can look to fight K'Sante level 1, if they start Q, Auto -> E -> Auto -> Phase Rush out
   - If they start E, they won't Q you as you walk up, so try to predict their E dash with your E
- Generally don't try to overtrade level 1, K'Sante has so much regen with DShield, and you have very low kill potential, the damage won't matter much. Focus on CS'ing 

HOW TO TRADE
- You can only trade with K'Sante pre first base. Once he gets any amount of armor, any trade is negative for you. 
- You can never really go aggressive in this lane, just trying to outscale and be more useful in teamfights
- As he goes for CS, look for small Q + Leg poke. Be respectful of his Q range, and his E -> Q range as well. If Q's a minion, you can look for longer trades
- You can buffer your E into his Q3 knockup
   - Be careful with this, as they can W or E to counter your E buffer if they know about it
- Once he gets his first armor item (Chain Vest) HE IS OMEGA HITLER. He can dash (E) at you in your own wave and still win the trade. 
   - Preemptively click down to dodge his E->Q combo
- You can never E at him if he has W or E up. 
- You can buffer E into K'Sante W (make sure your E hits during the dash, not the channel). The timing on this buffer is a little tricky as he can change how long he holds W
   - This interaction makes it hard for K'Sante to ever ult you/force the all-in, as you can phase rush to safety during the stun
- Just try your best to interact minimally and keep your farm even. K'Sante is one of the few champs that can beat Urgot at 9/Black Cleaver

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always be mindful of your Phase Rush cooldown, if it's down it's really easy for K'Sante to Q -> W -> R chain slow you down, especially with Icebourne Gauntlet
- A good K'Sante can buffer his R into your W, so even if you E buffer his W, he can W -> R and cancel your E 
- If he Q3's you under your tower, you have to E AWAY FROM HIM, or else he can W-> R you over the wall
- He has no mana costs in Ult form, so don't get baited by him appearing OOM
- Watch your positioning near walls when trying to trade/gank K'Sante. Don't give him a R kidnap angle if your jungle ganks

TIPS
- Outscaling K'Sante in the 1v1 is really hard, even at 9/Black Cleaver.  His W is hard for Urgot to dodge, but he's much clunkier in teamfights and falls off hard then compared to Urgot
- His W does not immune him from your R2, it will just delay the pull until his W animation completes'

- Lee Sin looks to perma push/out sustain, hard to trade 

- Don't E if he has W up

- Make sure you dodge his E radius, look to Q + PTA afterwards

- Can E into his Q2, but usually they'll W out trying to bait it
'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,250 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E92: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind him and fight level 1, but only a small Auto -> E -> Auto PTA trade. Don't extend the trade for his Conq + 2nd Q rotation

HOW TO TRADE
- Lee Sin top looks to waveclear/poke with E, and outsustain with W. Doesn't really play for the 1v1
- Everytime he walks up look to Q -> PTA/Leg combo. Can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all in at 6 if hes ~70%HP
   - Again, he has a lot of sustain with W and no mana costs, so don't force it unless he's taken a lot of damage
- Be careful of his E radius, he will spam it on the wave, make sure it doesn't hit you as well
- You cannot E him if he has W up + minions nearby to dash to
- If he ever Q -> Q2s you, you can E into him and chunk him hard. They usually won't do this though unless it's guaranteed lethal
- You can buffer E into Lee Sin kick (R), the timing is a little tricky though. Pay attention on ganks/trades when they make it obvious they want to kick you
   - Especially if they Q onto you while getting ganked, be ready to E backwards if he tries to ward hop -> R behind you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q -> Q2 -> Ward hop mid animation to bait out your E

TIPS
- This pick isn't very common anymore, and it's rather weak. It's hard to win lane as he's very slippery and has high sustain, but you omega outscale him in the 1v1 and in teamfights.
- As long as you don't give him kills in lane, it's a useless pick

- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, but need AP to kill him in teamfights'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,251 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E95: Details='EARLY GAME
- Malphite is really weak level 1, look to get behind him and fight. If he does not facecheck the bush and get into E range, careful to not let him just Q you for free and run away with the MS
- If he has E start, look to Auto -> Flip -> Make space so he can't E -> Auto -> Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- If Malphite ever gets in E range, look to flip, especially if you have legs/equal items
- This is a poke lane, try your best to use TP + Cull + Dblade + Pots to stay health enough to eat farm until 9/Black Cleaver
   - Really important to save your TP to reset for when he pokes you out too hard.
- Malphite will max range Q + Comet you on repeat until you're in lethal. You can't really interact since max range Q + MS lets him kite your E
   - TAKE CONTROL OF THE BRUSHES, don't let him Q you for free. Make him work for it.
   - Early on, E for the shield + Auto + Leg whenever he walks up to Q you
   - You're playing to outsustain his mana pool
- If he has no Q, you can look to Q->PTA/Leg trade, or even Q->E Flip. Careful if you flip pre-9, Malphite in the long lane with armor (Warden's Mail, etc) can run you down and kill you
- Once you break his shield, try to hit him with autos to keep it ticking. Be careful of overusing mana in this lane, as you can't really kill.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Malphite is really hard to kill after his first base for armor. Try to get as much of a lead as you can before then.
- Malphite is really strong level 6+ with an Armor Component, don't ego and just focus on keeping your farm up
- If Malphite rushes Thornmail, it's really hard to win 1v1, even at Black Cleaver. Pray you have AP Carries and play to eat farm + teamfight, not 1v1

TIPS
- Level 1-2, Malphite Q costs a ton of mana and only is worth for him if he has Comet + Manaflowbind up. Stand in front of him and try to baitt him to Q you when those are down 
- If Malphite goes grasp, it's a free win. If they have to actually auto/enter your E range, you can hard win trades
- Don't toggle at level 9+ if he has E attack speed slow on you
- It's hard to kill Malphite, but it's hard for Malphite to kill you, and you outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver. In teamfights, as long as you have some magic damage, you're more useful
- His ult cannot immune Urgot R2, it will execute him after the animation

- Trade when he misses Q, you can E buffer thru Q

- If he Ws you, E behind yourself to flip him as he becomes targetable

- Hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver and for rest of game. 

- Maokai has insane teamfighting, so play sidelane'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,253 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E98: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Maokai and trade hard, buffer his Q with your E if you can get close enough. 
- Try to deny the first 3 EXP or CS, you should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Maokai is short range, just play around his Smash (Q). 
- Wiggle around his max Q range, it's a bit longer than your auto range. Look for Q->PTA/Leg trade if he misses/uses Q
   - Usually Maokai CS'es with Q, so look for trades everytime he does so. USE YOUR RANGE
- You can look to Q->E combo Maokai and buffer his E through his Q. Make sure close the gap as much as possible before Eing, it makes it easier to buffer E
- If he ever Roots (W) you, E BEHIND YOURSELF to Flip him after he becomes targetable again
- Don't let him get free Grasp + passive autos and free Q poke on you, and he has no tools to fight back. 
   - Deny him CS and outscale


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Maokai W can dodge your E and your R, be careful E'ing Maokai normally. 
   - If his W is up, E + Flash or look to BUFFER E THROUGH HIS Q
   - Also do not R Maokai unless he's E stunned, or wait for him to get out of range so he has no W targets
- Maokai has really nice gank setup, get vision out after you crash waves to not die to jungle
- From 7-9, Maokai (with 4 points Q) with armor items/bami is actually strong, respect until 9

TIPS
- This is a relatively easy tank lane, he has a lot less laning pressure than most tanks but better scaling. 
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, and decisively win 1v1 the rest of the game. However, his teamfight power is better than yours so really look to establish AT LEAST a CS lead in lane
- Try to play side lane vs Maokai later on as he wants to only teamfight

2025-05-04 23:07:03,253 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E101: Details='EARLY GAME
- If you have Ignite, you can look to fight Mordekaiser early. 
- However, Mordekaiser lvl 1 is no joke. You have to get the jump on him Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA, and kite with your legs. 
   - His passive + Conq + 2nd Q cast can make it a close fight
- Usually, just look to E thru the first 3 melees and FLIP Mordekaiser as he Qs them -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage 
   - If you can Flip him here into a chunk, it's huge for your lane
- Should get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- After the first 3 levels, Mordekaiser stat checks you until 9/Black Cleaver
- Your goal is to not contest/play aggro unless he's ~60% HP and in oneshot E + Flash + Ignite + R range. 
   - Look for small Q/Leg poke, but do not E forwards or play too aggro when he's higher HP.
   - His shield + Conq makes him really tanky after your E burst, you usually can't kill and then he ramps up and kills you
- Play around his Q, wiggle around its range and try to bait it out. 
   - If he uses/misses Q, look for a short Q->PTA/leg trade. 
- If he ever wastes shield (W) you can look to heavy trade/all-in if hes ~70%HP
- If he holds shield (W), hold your E in all-ins until hes around ~40% HP so you can burst him below execute 25% range during your E stun. 
   - Even if he shields after, your R will still execute him
- If he ever E's you and you can't dodge it, buffer E away 
   - You can "ride" his scoop (E) with your E, useful in flipping him under tower if he doesn't know

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL IN THE LONG LANE. Mordekaiser can just walk up -> R -> EQ  and force the all in from Full HP. Even if he can't kill you, you will lose way too much HP
- Mordekaiser shield (W) makes him deceptively tanky, be patient with your R after you Flip as he can time it out easily
- Use your Flash to dodge one of his Qs if he all-ins you
- Be careful of him using his Ult to trap you and setup a jungle gank

TIPS
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you, you literally can't fight pre-9 if he's equal pre-9
   - If the wave is pushing away from you, STAND ON YOUR MINIONS and bait him to Q you to push it back
- You can actually complete your R2 as he ults, you can yoink him out of his death realm (R)
- Really difficult lane, but it's Urgot favored at 9/Black Cleaver if you play the fight well. After level 13 and 2 items you hard outscale Mordekaiser for the rest of the game.
   - Mordekaiser is also not a great champ, he's really weak to ranged/kiting. If you fall behind, don't worry if your comp isn't 4+ melees.'

2025-05-04 23:07:03,255 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E104: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Nasus and fight level 1, ZONE HIM OFF THE FIRST 3 MELEE EXP. 
- If he walks up past you, try to flip him back towards his tower and PTA chunk for 70% of his HP
- If you chunked hard, look for E + Flash + W + Ignite kill at level 2. If there is no angle, look to freeze/setup a gank after the wave crashes then bounces back
   - As it bounces back, you can walk behind the wave (make sure you don't have minion aggro) and fight/zone off Nasus again
- Trading/deny EXP level 1 is critical in this lane, or else you can't punish Nasus pre-6.  You want to either take his HP and TP, or make him lose EXP.
   - Once he hits 6 the matchup gets really hard in an isolated 1v1 without a lead.

HOW TO TRADE
- Pre-6, if Nasus ever walks up, look to Q->E->Trade as hard as possible. 
- After 6, only look to Flip if hes ~60%HP and you have Ignite/items. His R is an insanely powerful 1v1 tool
   - Just look for Q->Leg/PTA trades until he's low enough to all-in
- Usually Nasus goes 3/4 points E with Dring/Tear, and just stands 10 screens back wave clearing.
   - Not much counterplay to this strat, do your best to dodge the E (impossible challenge)
   - MAKE HIM CHOOSE BETWEEN E'ING YOU OR THE WAVE: Stand on the side of the lane, and look to Q->Trade if he E's the wave
   - Preserve your HP vs this setup: don't overly force the freeze if your jungle isn't nearby
   - His stacks are low with this setup, but he can get CS/EXP. 
- If you haven't found a lead pre-6, play to just farm up until 9/Black Cleaver when you beat Nasus again.
   - Even if you found a lead, you can still easily lose at Nasus 6 + Sheen, focus on growing your CS lead, or chunking him out hard if you want to all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If Nasus runs Phase Rush, respect the cooldown before looking to all-in/R, as it also gives slow resist after
- Nasus R gives him lots of Resists + HP, so don't R too early or it will time out
- His wither (W) slow is really strong at setting up ganks, don't overextend looking too hard to trade

TIPS
- Don't toggle W if you are withered, just leave W on
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver, but eventually in the 1v1 he outscales depending on his stacks.
   - But your teamfight is much better than his due to Urgot's CC, just focus on E/Ring him when your team can focus him down

- You can really fight Neeko level 1 if she facechecks/gets near the bush
- If she has Q start, you can look to Auto -> E to gap close/shield -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage for a nice chunk 
- If she has clone (W) start, it's a little trickier as she can run out of your auto range. If she starts Dblade, she will usually start clone (W). You can still fight tho, just try to hold your E to bait out her W first
- If you can't trade level 1, focus on using brushes to avoid autos and match her push as best you can

HOW TO TRADE
- Neeko's high range/poke makes this matchup hard, you can only poke with Q
- Do your best to avoid her Q/E/Empowered W Auto
   - If she misses/uses E, you can look for a Q->PTA/Leg trade
   - If she has E up, try to dodge her Q and look for Q poke in return
   - Stand in brushes/respect when has empowered W auto up
- If you can poke her down enough, look for E + Flash + R + Ignite one shot
- I like to go early Dirk/AD items + Ignite in this matchup so I can flash her from high HP. Playing slow lets her poke you down too much, her Q is really hard to dodge
- If you're fast with E + Flash, you will still Flip her even if she clones as you Flip
- If you Flash to kill, make sure you have lethal. Her Clone + E + R can time out/disengage easily, and without Flash you can't play the game for 5 minutes

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful overextending a trade, as her W clone + MS can outrange you easily
- Neeko W can bodyblock your R and E

TIPS
- Count the minions to see if she's invisible, press tab and if her portrait lights up but you don't see her, she's disguised somewhere
- Always remember that if you "see" the enemy jungle on minimap, it could be Neeko. Don't think you're safe from jungle ganks.
- You can buffer E through her E and R

- Level 1 look to fight him before minions spawn, BUT DO NOT FIGHT PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE
   - Auto -> Try to get behind him and E him towards his tower -> Auto -> Phase Rush and disengage
   - If you look for anything more, he can ghost/Q chain slow you and win, as his Ghost lasts longer than Phase Rush
- If you don't fight before minions arrive, look to E Flip him as he CS'es the first 3 and Phase Rush away
- You should always get level 2 prio. Trading hard level 1 sets up a level 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill, which makes this lane A LOT easier

HOW TO TRADE
- You are actually stronger in this matchup pre-6, but once Olaf hits 6 NEVER INTERACT UNTIL 9/Black Cleaver
- Pre-6, look to use your range and Q+Legs to trade hard. 
   - Don't commit your E unless he's low enough to burst in W with Ignite, he gets too much lifesteal + shielding at low HP
   - If he's ~30-40% HP, and you have Ignite + Legs up, you can look to commit to an all-in 
- If Olaf has Ghost/TP, play for prio and call your jungler to gank when the wave bounces back. He has no counterplay to your E + Flash, and then you get his TP on a frozen wave
   - If Olaf has Ghost/Flash, can do the same play, they usually won't react to E + Flash. 
      - Look to kill, or at least chunk and force him to base on a frozen wave with no TP
      - Be a little careful, as if you Flash too early and he's not low enough, he can trade 1 for 1
- If he throws his axe (Q) too far away, look for a Q->Leg trade, he has no all-in threat if he can't pick up his axe
- Post-6, always look to hold the wave and freeze. Be careful when the wave is pushing out. OLAF WANTS THE LONG LANE TO GHOST/Q YOU DOWN IN AN ALL-IN
   - If the wave starts pushing out, stand in your minions and bait him to Q so it pushes back to you
   - Never walk into his Q range unless you have PHASE RUSH up
- Most Olafs will panic R when you R them if they're in execute hp. 
   - Hold your R2, Olafs ult will time out and then you can R2 him in for the execute
- Try to bait him to all in you, then use Phase Rush/E to disengage. He is much weaker without his Ult than you post-9
- You can win at level 9/Black Cleaver vs Olaf if you have Ignite + get the first jump on him, but you will lose if he can instantly melee range/fight you. 
   - Use your range + Phase Rush movement speed to space him

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Olaf R prevents you from E'ing or R executing him, which is why this matchup is hard
- He gets increased lifesteal/shielding when low, you NEED ANTI-HEAL (Ignite or item) to kill at any point in the game
- His ult lasts for as long as he can auto, so try to disengage ASAP to let it time out
- It's often not worth to get your jungler to gank Olaf until 9/Black Cleaver, you don't have any damage/CC thru his R and he can 1v2 easily


TIPS
- You can use Ignite for Nimbus Cloak MS as another disengage tool if your Phase Rush is down
- Olaf R costs 100 mana, so he runs into a lot of mana issues nowdays if he spams axe (Q). If he has <100 mana, can look to E + Flash + R even when he's 6
- You CAN win past 9 if played well, but it's still a 50-50. Unless you're ahead, Olaf's 1v1 is always strong vs Urgot, but his teamfighting is much worse usually.
   - Focus on getting through lane even, then being more useful in 5v5s'

- Save your TP and take bases when you can, so he can't build too many items on you

- Space his W/Brittle autos

- Outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver and omega outscale as the game goes on

- Look to fight Ornn level 1 with Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA disengage. 
- Ornn doesn't really take a lot of damage, so focus on CSing over trading in this lane after the level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- Interacting with Ornn before 9/Black Cleaver is always negative. We can never flip forwards in this lane, just farm up and outscale
   - His ability to build items in lane means you have to preserve your TP and TAKE RESETS WHEN YOU CAN
   - He only takes damage before he buys, once he has any armor component/bamis he is exodia
- His Q is his main poke ability + sets up larger trades with Q->E. Focus on dodging the Q damage and move away from the pillar immediately
   - Ornn's will usually throw Q to CS, so don't stack on top of your minions
- If Ornn ever looks to Q->E combo you, be ready to buffer E away to deny an extended trade from him
- Ornn breath (W) will deny your Flip, but HE WILL STILL BE STUNNED AFTER. If you E -> Ornn Ws, insta click away while he's stunned so he can't brittle auto you
- If you do have to fight, try to walk behind him as he W's to avoid the Brittle
- If he does waste his Q, W, or E, you can look for Q->PTA/Leg trades before he can W you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always look to stop him from building for free when you can by hitting him. Try to make him choose between building really far away and giving CS/EXP.
   - Some Ornn's will fake build in your face to bait you into Q->E range, or to waste your mana. 
   - Sometimes just standing close to Ornn without hitting/Qing is enough to stop his build
- Ornn's triple brittle combo with Ult legit can oneshot you from 80%HP if you're overextended. Do not disrespect Ornn's damage post-6
- You can buffer E into Ornn's Brittle auto knockback, but the timing is tricky. If you E too early he can knockdown your E with the auto
- If you have Brittle on you, if you're on top of Ornn's Q as it spawns, it will literally push you and consume the Brittle proc for damage


TIPS
- When Ornn summons his R, look to E or E + Flash before he gets it off, if they W they can't recast R2
- Ornn W will not deny your R2, it will execute after his W animation
- After level 9, Most Ornn's will use their E to run away. If you're fast enough, you can Q->E and grab him out of his E since it has an animation delay
- You hard outscale Ornn after 9/Black Cleaver as you can take extended trades now, and you outscale 1v1 for the rest of the game. He does bring equal teamfight value though, so if you can play sidelane it's better

- If Pantheon has Ignite + Conq, do not fight early game, his Q does too much damage
- If he has TP, You can look for Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage
- Prio can go either way in this matchup, just really focus on not taking too many Qs level 1. He can space your E with his Q, so if you don't get the angle don't force it and preserve HP
   - REALLY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T OVERAGGRO LEVEL 1 AND LOSE FREE HP TO PANTH Q, ITS TOO HIGH RANGE/LOW CD TO OUTPLAY

HOW TO TRADE
- You can't really force trades if he has Q, it outranges you. Try to wiggle at his Q range, and if you dodge it look for a Q->PTA/Leg combo.
   - This lane just comes down to respecting his Q poke and range until you outscale.
- You can buffer E into his W, just be on the look out for it as it comes fast
   - Pre-9 however you don't want to E forwards unless hes ~60-70% HP, as he can kill you with Conq + Q + Ignite 
   - Post-9, if you E his W you insta kill him
- Just play slow and look to small trade with Q/Legs while dodging his Qs. If he wastes E, or he's <60%HP you can look to one shot with E + Flash + Ignite + R
- His E CAN Block your R2, and a lot of your E + Flash damage, but usually they will E the wrong way.
   - If they E towards you -> You E Flip them -> you can deal damage as they're E'ing the wrong way now
- If you look to Flip -> all-in with R, only press R once so you can wait for his E to expire

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- RESPECT HIS EMPOWERED Q EXECUTE DAMAGE. It does a lot with Ignite, you never want to be <50%HP in lane vs Panth
- Spam ping if he goes MIA, his R is a strong ganking tool on mid lane
- His Q is actually really hard to dodge front-to-back, it's long. If you have to walk into his Q range, try dodging side to side

TIPS
- Pantheon is strong level 1-5, but falls off around level 6f as you get a combat ult and he doesn't. 
- He gets hard outscaled by level 9/Black Cleaver and is way weaker in 1v1s/teamfiights for the rest of the game.
- His strength is snowballing off his early game, and collecting kills around the map, so focus on not dying/getting poked out and farming'

- Look to get behind Poppy and fight level 1, but if she doesn't enter E range don't force it
- As the minions crash, they usually CS the first 3 with Q. Try to E -> PTA -> Disengage
- If she's not giving you E range, use your E for gapclose/shield -> Auto + Leg if she throws her buckler (Passive) auto at you

HOW TO TRADE
- Play slow in this lane, use your range + autos to do work, if she can hit you back with Q+ Passive it's losing
- When she has her buckler (Passive up), stay in bush/give CS until she consumes it. Earlier in the game you can E just to shield the damage -> Auto + Leg
- You can never E Poppy when she has her circle (W) up, but it does have a higher CD than your E
   - Against worse players, you can look to test their reactions on W level 1-3. Sometimes they won't press it, especially if you're a little closer to them
- BE TIGHT WITH YOUR SPACING. Poppy Q is about the same range as your auto, very slightly shorter 
   - When she walks up, Q->Leg/PTA trade, but be sure to use max range auto so she can't Q you
- If she's ~60% HP or wastes W, you can look for E + Flash + R kill. 
   - The best Poppys can W your E + Flash, so be respectful depending on your Elo
- If you can kill, lead with R -> They will channel R -> Buffer Poppy R with your E -> Kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Poppys will use their E on minions as a gapcloser/escape
   - Be careful of Poppy E'ing a minion -> right on top of you for Q -> you can't E because she has W
   - Also be careful of E + Flashing when she has a minion to E to for escape
- Always pay attention to how close you are to walls for her E, she does too much damage if she gets the stun off. 
   - The upper walls of top lane are closer than they seem
- Without flash up, you can't live a gank vs Poppy + Jungler as you can't E away and she can perma slow you

TIPS
- You can buffer Poppy E and R with your E. Both are tricky timings, especially the E
   - You need fast reactions for Poppy E bufer. Whenever you walk near a wall, just hover your E button. You will still get stunned, but you'll also Flip + Stun Poppy
   - Poppy R is a little easier, give some space so you can react
- YOU CAN FLIP (E) POPPY WITH HER CIRCLE (W) ON, IF YOU ARE ON TOP OF HER MODEL. 
   - If you are that close, it will insta flip, so it's not considered a dash, but you have to be RIGHT ON HER MODEL.
   - If she E+W,  you can buffer E into her E and W won't knock you down as you are close enough
- Recasting R2 will cancel knockbacks, so if Poppy has R'ed you while you R2 execute someone, it will put you back on the ground 
- Poppy always has relevancy due to her W, but you hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver'

- Level 1, try to get behind Quinn and E her. 
- They usually don't get in E range, so try to predict buffer E into her E. 
   - They usually Auto -> E, so try to time it after the first Auto
   - If you buffer successfully she literally just dies level 1
- If you can't, just try to take brush and match her push. Don't take too many free autos.

HOW TO TRADE
- Quinn is really weak to Urgot E as it puts her behind Urgot, so she can't E away like normal
- Stand behind minions to dodge her blind (Q) and Q poke until shes 75% HP, then look for E + Flash + R + Ignite oneshot
   - Only go for auto attacks if her Q/E is down
- Buffering E into Quinn E is always a guaranteed kill, but a really hard timing to get down as Quinn E comes out FAST.
   - They usually E after an empowered auto, so look to E around that timing
- If she's even slightly chunked (2-3 Qs), you can one shot at 6 with Ignite + Dirk/AD Components. Don't be afraid to just E + Flash
- It's important you don't waste your E, as she can take all your HP running you down with her MS + Passive autos

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q'ing against good Quinns, they can E OVER it and dodge it.
   - For some real mindgames, if they do this, you can buffer E as soon as you Q, that way if they E to dodge your Q you Flip them
- Her level 6 is really annoying for just roaming, make sure to spam your mid/jungle to be careful
- Keep her W vision reveal in mind when trying to cheese, I like to stand in the Alcove or really far back so she can't spot me

TIPS
- If you E + Flash Quinn, make sure to keep kiting towards her tower so she can't E to safety
- If you get a lead on Quinn, it's really hard for her to play 1v1, and you one shot her with E the entire game. She will just try to roam around the map, so make sure you punish if she does'

- Should always get level 2 prio, look to just slow push and get some deep vision

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is weird, you can only look to trade when his W isn't on. 
- If he has W on, only auto attack him if you have a leg up
- Look to trade and bait ous his W. Wait for his W to expire before dumping Q + PTA + W on him. 
   - If he takes enough damage with W down, you can kill with R
- Just use your range + autos whenever you can, try not to commit too much mana as he's hard to kill
- It's actually not that bad of a matchup because he has no kill pressure, just annoying. Just farm up and scale
- If you can flip him in front of tower with W on, you can kill him as he will get aggro

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- MAKE SURE YOU TURN W OFF BEFORE HE TAUNTS (E) YOU. You will insta die as each of your W ticks make you take full damage from his W + Thornmail
- His R is a pretty fast dash, so be patient with your R or wait for your E stun
- They usually look for the proxy, try to ward the river so you can see if he tries to. If you have an AP Jungler you can easily kill him.

TIPS
- Rammus is an easy lane, but even if he's 0-10 he will be UNKILLABLE if you don't have consistent AP damage (Azir good, Nidalee bad)
   - I would dodge if we were 3-4+ AD champs
- You never can really kill Rammus after he gets Thornmail, he just gets too much armor. Play to E/R him in teamfights where your AP champs can hit him'

HOW TO TRADE
- Use your range in this matchup, Q + PTA/Leg trade every time she tries to walk up for CS
- If you E first while Rek'Sai is burrowed, she can cancel it with burrowed W (knockup), so it's hard to E aggressively in this lane.
   - If she is unborrowed and below 70%, you can look to E. 
- If Rek'Sai tries to knock you up (W) first, you can buffer E and flip her. Be prepared for this if she tunnels (E) at you
- Realistically save E for E + Flash when she's around 50% HP.
   - She has to be lower than usual because she can time out your R with her R animation
- Her main tool is her SUSTAIN. Keep your spacing tight and don't enter her melee Q range, and you should always win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rek'Sai R can actually dodge your R2 if timed properly
- She can set up ganks really well with her tunnels, so respect jungle

TIPS
- This is a rather useless pick nowadays, it's weak in lane and gets MASSIVELY outscaled by Urgot in 1v1 and teamfights. 
- It's hard to force on Rek'Sai, so just play slow and grow a CS lead and outscale

- Usually they start E, so Auto -> E backwards to try to predict his E through you. Even if you can't catch him with E, the free autos is still decent
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Renekton's has good short trades, good long trades (Conq + R), and high sustain (Q). He is a lane bully, so our primary goal should be to go even until 9/Black Cleaver
- Pay attention to his fury. If he has low fury, you can play aggressive with Q + PTA/Leg trades when he steps up. If he has high fury you have to respect
- Be tight with your spacing, try to get Q/Auto poke while avoiding his Q
- Buffering E into Renekton stun (W) is a good window to trade, they look to E->W (buffer E before they can E out)
   - HOWEVER, don't E forwards in the long lane if he's level 6 and now <60%HP, as his Ult + Conq can run you down
- Good Renketons will mix up his trading pattern, E-> Q -> E is hard to react to, just try to space his initial E
- Don't try to over trade in this lane, he has a lot of sustain, no mana, and stronger trades.

- If he doesn't facecheck, keep control of the brushes, and use your ward to keep vision as you go to CS
- Should get level 2 prio


HOW TO TRADE
- Rengar's W makes every trade winning for him before you have antiheal, game plan is to keep bushes warded and stand on the far side so he can't jump you
- AVOID FIGHTING NEAR BUSHES. Look to just play slow and scale up, if he gives you angles to poke take them and you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot if hes <60% HP.
   - Just make sure he has low ferocity stacks, as he can Empowered W your R2
- RUSH ANTIHEAL. Once you get antiheal you can take more aggressive trades, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade after he jumps to CS a minion. 
   - You can even try to predict E as he jumps

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rengar Empowered W can cleanse your Flip, stun, AND R2. Make sure to keep track of his ferocity when R/E'ing
- If you ward the brush and rengar sees it, he can insta oneshot it with Q. Make sure when you ward the brush he doesn't see it
- Spam ping when he goes MIA, his Ult is great at ganking your jungle/mid
- Leaping from brush at 0 ferocity gives him a stack, so be careful of his empowered cast in one spell rotation from brush

TIPS
- ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP THE BRUSH NEAREST YOUR TOWER WARDED. 
   - Then you don't have to be afraid of his bush cheese as the wave bounces back to him
- Rengar can't play when he's pushed in or frozen on, as he can't use the bushes to fight. 
- Keep the early game stable, that's his only window to cheese you. Once you're level 9, you hard statcheck Rengar, he can never jump you, and just keep him perma pushed in so he can't do anything

- Ideally wait for minions to crash, then look to E flip + PTA while they Q to CS the first 3, then kite back to your own minion wave

HOW TO TRADE
- SPACING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, always keep Riven at max range and use your Q + Autos + Legs to poke her down
   - If she Q's forwards, look for a Q -> PTA/Leg trade to deter her from coming closer with Q
   - Make her have to use E + Q1 to gapclose if she wants to trade, if she can Q early for damage it's hard
- This lane is based around her shield (E) CD. If it's up you have to respect and can't commit your E
- Look to Flip (E) on her stun (W) or Q3.
   - Q3 is riskier to E at, as it's higher range, and she can E away before your E connects, Don't recommend E'ing Riven's Q3 unless they're noobs
   - Better Rivens will look to E forwards -> W -> Auto -> Q out. Be prepared to flip during E->W, you will kill if you do this, but the timing is hard
- Repeat trades until shes 60-70%HP. If she wastes her E, you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R kill
- A good Riven will be hard to kill, so just focus on applying pressure with your auto + Q range. Build a CS lead and outscale.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL TO NOT LET HER BAIT YOUR E, IF YOU MISS E YOU DIE. 
- Riven is one of the best proxy champs, don't let her as she can easily kill your Jungler. Try to put vision in river and watch her if she tries to go around
- Do not underestimate Conq + Ignite + Level 6 Riven, she can kill you from 80%HP

TIPS
- This matchup is generally good for Urgot as he wins early + outscales, but Riven can definitely outplay at 6 with Ignite.  
   - If you fight anywhere not near your tower, be careful that she can just flash your E if you all-in (even from full HP)
- The longer the game goes the harder you outscale.  Hitting E on Riven in teamfights = instakill.

- You can look to trade with Rumble level 1 if you get behind him, they usually start E
- If he respects the cheese and doesn't check the bush, don't try to overforce. The E slow + damage is too hard to outplay
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- It's really hard to trade with Rumble after level 2-3, since his flamethrower (Q), W MS, and E slow let him space you easily. Give CS and preserve your HP.
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you. If he tries to Q you, stand your ground in your wave with Q + PTA/Legs. 
   - If you fight back, Rumble will click away meaning his Q won't be hitting you for a little
- Try your hardest to not fall behind. If you can't stand your ground in your wave, he can run behind your wave and Q->E you without consequences
- It's hard to play slow in this matchup, as he will just poke you down. Try to trade hard early game, then look to E + Flash + W + Ignite at level 2-3 for a kill
   - Even if you chunk + trade flashes, it's still fine
- If he ever wastes W, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade, or even an all-in if he's low enough
- At level 6, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill if hes ~70%HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he's near OVERHEAT, if you look to E + Flash and don't kill him in the Stun, his overheat autos HURT
- Dodge his E's, if he can hit both on you they shred a lot of MR and you get oneshot
- Rumble Q and E DO NOT DRAW MINION AGGRO, so don't feel too safe in a big wave.

TIPS
- It's quite hard to dodge Rumble E due to your large hitbox, standing behind minions is your best bet 
- If you Flip Rumble in Q, his Q will not face you, you can reduce some damage in the all-in this way
- If you fall behind/struggle, sitting on a Negatron Cloak isn't bad
- You outscale Rumble at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind, and demolish him as the game goes on in 1v1/teamfights. Going down 20CS in this lane is fine, just focus on getting EXP and not dying'

- Level 1 look to get behind him and fight. Usually he will start W, so if he doesn't enter E range, just Auto -> E to Gapclose/shield -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Play for level 2 prio, should get it
- If he's chunked enough, look to E + Flash + W level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Ryze outranges you and has strong poke, as well as strong disengage with W + Phase Rush
- Stand behind minions and look for Q poke. 
   - If he has no angle to bounce/hit Q on you, can extend Q->PTA/Leg trade
- If he gives range, Look to Q->E gapclose 
   - When you get near with Q slow + Approach Velocity MS, most Ryze's will try to root
   - BUFFER E THROUGH RYZE ROOT to hard win the trade. It's the same range as your E so if you E as soon as you're in range to flip, it will go thru usually
- Repeat until he's ~60%HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal
- Lane is tricky, especially because Ryze goes HP in Catalyst/ROA so he's hard to oneshot
- Don't overforce, if you take too much poke it's hard to play the all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Respect his ability to kite you with Phase Rush, W slow, and range.
- Be careful of standing too close to minions, Ryze can E->Q chain off the minions to hit you
- If you look to E + Flash + R, be aware that you only have 2s to kill with R, as he will Ult out himself

TIPS
- Merc Treads rush helps a ton in landing E. 
- Ryze scales really well, harder than Urgot, but post 9 (and especially if you get movement speed items like Youmuu's) you one shot him 1v1. 
- As long as you can get on top of Ryze and Flip, you win.'

EARLY GAME

- If she starts Q, she can knockdown your E. Look to trade Autos 
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Play around her W, it's her main damage ability. If she uses it, kite side to side to dodge it
   - When it's on cooldown look for Q->PTA/Leg trade
- You can Buffer her Dash (Q) with E, they usually don't Q in but be ready to Flip if she does
- Be ready to buffer E away from her R or stun (E). She has really low kill threat in lane but sets up ganks extremely well
- Maintain your spacing, and play to punish her on every CS with Q/Autos. As long as you don't eat too many Ws, she can't do much and you outscale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E at her first, she can knock it down with Q.
- Her burst damage with R + Ignite + her full combo does a lot of damage, don't disrespect if you're ~60%HP

TIPS
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game 1v1. She has good utility in teamfights, but yours is better. Try to play sidelane as you are much stronger there

- Be careful in fighting Sett level 1, he's strong with W + Conq. 
- As the minions crash, auto him once. If you see his Grit stack, disengage (he has W) and just play for push, small chip autos.
- If it doesn't, he has E and you can look to Auto -> Flip -> Auto Auto PTA. 
   - Try to buffer E through his E
- You should always get level 2 prio as long as you don't give him a big W charge

HOW TO TRADE
- Don't let him stack W. Look for small Q + PTA trades, then insta disengage before he can E->W you.
   - If he Ws, you will have enough range to dodge the center by moving side to side
- Sett has long CDs, but it's hard to make him use them unfavorably. Just farming and outscaling in this matchup is good
   - Of course if he does waste his W, you can look to take a big trade. 
- Never E forwards aggressively until 9/Black Cleaver unless he's chunked. He has really good extended trades with Conq + W
- If he tries to Q for MS -> E you to force trades, be ready to buffer E away. If you can do this, he can't ever force trades on you. 
- If hes ~40-50% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R one shot before he can W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He has really high sustain when he gets low, if you don't have Ignite, don't overforce trying to kill him without E unless you have R to execute
- Sett R cancels your E completely, so be careful E'ing around him.
- Also be careful when E'ing forwards in lane, as he can ult you back into his tower/side of the map to extend the trade

TIPS
- You can actually flip Sett as he W's behind you, so that his W completely misses. However this is risky as the timing has to be clean, and if he combos E->W it could mess it up
- You are stronger at 9/Black Cleaver, but nothing too crazy. As the game goes on you destroy him, especially if you can bait out/dodge the W, he has nothing
- In teamfights just make sure you don't give Sett an angle to R you into your backline
   - If you E->R Sett in fights with followup, often you can 1shot him so fast they can't even press W

- Look to just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA as he tries to CS the first 3 creeps
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is all about spacing and playing your range + autos. Shen should never be able to walk up and Q + Grasp auto you
   - His Q does give him 50 more AA range
- You can buffer E into his taunt (E). Early game if they are aggro they might taunt you, be ready to buffer E 
   - If he's close to you, buffer E backwards.
   - If he's farther away, you can buffer E at him
- Don't lead with E in trades, as he can W or E away himself.
- If you flip him, hold W for after his W. They usually will drop their zone (W) immediately
- Shen's laning power is really low. It's important you focus on wave management. 
   - You always want to SLOW PUSH, to be able to crash a big wave and deny Shen EXP/CS if he Ults away at 6
      - You can also freeze, but pushing is way better
- SPAM PING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF SHEN ULT WHEN HE HITS 6, THE ONLY THING SHEN CAN DO IS MAKE YOUR TEAM LOSE (Which is pretty big)

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Shen's Q does more damage if he drags it through your body (it also slows you if you are running away)
- Shen can nullify you in teamfights quite hard with his Ult + W + Taunt to deny your E and R

TIPS
- I like Demolish in this matchup as you can take a plate or 2 every time he Ults away
- Once you hit 9, if Shen just sits under his tower, look to proxy waves and create tempo on the map so he can't R away easily

- If Singed starts in lane, just walk at him and fight him ASAP. He's so weak level 1, you cook him if you hit E
   - Be careful if Singed Qs the wave, if you miss E/get kited, he can hit level 2 fast

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is super easy. You outrange and bully Singed, ouscale him, and can even deny his Flip (E) with your own E buffer
- Watch out for 3 things:
   1) Singed E + Flash into his W ground under his tower
        - If you are careful with your autos/read his body language for when he wants to Flash, this is easily outplayable
   2) Singed getting to Proxy
        - NEVER GRIEF YOUR TEMPO, WARD THE RIVER/WRAP AROUND ENTRANCES, AND KEEP PUSHING HIM IN OR FREEZING
        - Conciously think about how Singed could potentially proxy you and look to stop it. 
        - Singed can only play the game if he can proxy, so you want to deny him the proxy AT ALL COSTS
   3) Jungle ganks
        - He has really good gank setup, so try to get deep vision out before you push Singed in
- If you don't blunder those 3 things, Singed can literally not play. Use your Range and punish/deny him off every CS With Q + PTA/Leg trades
- You can buffer his E by E'ing backwards.Uno Reverse you flip him instead
- You can buffer E while his W goo is midair, so he can't ground you from Eing

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Read the above section
- Conq Ignite Singed can be quite scary at level 6. 

TIPS
- Singed will usually have to give up EXP/CS and roam a lot in this matchup. Give your mid/bot lots of MIA pings
- If Singed is in the proxy position, it's worth giving a wave to push him out if your jungle is on your side. If you can't, look to proxy yourself if you're level 9
- You hard outscale Singed, but he provides lots of utility in teamfights even if really behind. Look to sidelane a lot, he can't really stop you from just taking the towers'

- Level 1 look to fight, just look for Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage trade
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Like most tank lanes, this matchup is not bad until Sion gets his first armor item on base (esp Steelcaps or Wardens mail)
- Sion can space and take small trades vs Urgot really easily with his E/Q knockup/W shield
   - It's hard for Urgot to outplay. We just look to not interact and outscale
- If he wastes Q or W, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade
- Unless Sion is chunked or really behind, don't E forwards unless near your tower. He's so tanky you're never killing, and he can win the extended trade with his 2nd Q rotation
- The only interaction is trying to buffer Sion Q with E, but it's really hard as Sion can release Q at any point
   - This buffer interaction takes a lot of experience to know when to "time" your E
   - You can try to time it on the max charged Sion Q (it's always the same time), but that's risky since it will do a lot of damage + Stun you for a longer time. Generally not worth to go for
   - The closer you are to Sion the easier it is to buffer E, max range Es into his Q are much easier for him to knockdown. 
- Approach Velocity is clutch in this matchup as you can gapclose Q->E fast enough before he can charge his Q enough

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Pay attention to your minions, Sion will try to E them thru you to slow so he can trade with his Q
- Sion R can immune your R2. Generally no way around this since his ult lasts way longer than yours does, you can't just time it out

TIPS
- Try to break his shield (W) before he can activate it, then it does no damage
- You can buffer E into sion R
- You hard outscale Sion with your %HP Legs and Ult. Just make sure you don't fall behind in lane and in teamfights, he's really easy to E->R '

- This is a really easy matchup, the only thing Sylas can do is max Q and farm from range
- If he ever E2's you, just buffer E into it and he gets 1shot with Ignite
- Don't E if he has E up. Just use your range, Q + Auto + PTA + Legs demolish Sylas, he's really squishy
- Sometimes Sylas will gapclose with W (it's a short dash), if you're ready you can snag them with E on this. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If he is putting points in Q, make sure you are dodging them. The delayed Q explosion does more damage, so don't get hit by that
- Be careful if he can take good ults like Swain or Alistar in teamfights

- Stand behind minions so he can't Q you and TK can't interact with you.

- Watch his grey health -> shield when looking to all-in with R. 
   - Try to save your E for when hes ~40% so that even if he shields after, he'll be under the 25% R Execute range still


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

- Respect the blind in timing your R out

- Don't flip early game if he's full HP, chunk him first or he can win the all-in with blind + Ignite

- Merc tread rush is strong, with approach + MS you can combo Q->E flip

- Hard outscale 9+, you're 10x Teemo in 5v5'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,283 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E170: Details='EARLY GAME
- Teemo has really high auto range, so it's unlikely you can Flip level 1.
- As the minions crash, take the bush. When he autos, E for shield -> Auto -> Disengage
   - If Teemo starts blind (Q), his AA dmg is weak and it's hard for him to push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke teemo out with Q until hes ~70% HP, then you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot
- If Teemo uses/wastes his blind (Q), you can look to take a heavier Q->PTA trade
   - If he has blind (Q) up, don't look to over trade
- If Teemo moves to close to you, you can look to Q->E if he's under 60-70% HP. Be careful Flipping if he's full HP, since his blind + Ignite can win an all-in before 6
- Teemo will always die if you hit Flip (E), but he's very fast with a small hitbox. Be patient, slowly Q poke him down, then E + Flash, or look to Q->E->R
   - If he wastes his blind (Q) for random poke don't be afraid to E flash all in
- Your Q is really important, use it to space/push Teemo back if he tries to trade. If you miss it Teemo can look to sprint at you and AA you down. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E + Flash + R all-in when Teemo has blind (Q) up, make sure you know your lethal limits, since he can time half your ult out with Q
- Try to keep a ward in the bush closest to your tower, so you can see if he goes invisible there to cheese after the wave crashes into your tower

TIPS
- If you ever E him and he blinds you before he gets stunned, hold your W until you are unblinded
- Teemo has high auto range, so TAKE THE BUSH. 
- Rushing merc treads is strong, the extra movement speed helps with combing Q->E and tenacity reduces the blind duration
- Swap to Red trinket at 9 to clear shrooms
- Annoying champ in lane, but falls off hard. You are much stronger in sidelane/teamfights if not behind!

- Don't E forwards pre-9, he can run you down. Be careful in the long lane

- His E can cancel your E, wait for it

- Go full damage build, not tank,you need to kill him in sidelane later

- You outscale in 5v5, the 1v1 is always tricky but you can easily win if you get a lead

- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range
   - Save E > R combo for when he's ~60-70% HP. 
       - Ult won't time out
       - If you insta E, they may insta R, making the 1v1 hard
       - If they hold R, you can 1shot him in the E flip depending on your items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Trundle can cancel your E with his pillar (E) if timed well. 
- Trundle's level 6 is extremely strong 1v1, be very respectful especially if he has ghost + the long lane


TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well
   - If you have enough damage, Trundle gets one shot in your E flip before he can Ult/ramp up'

- Walk ahead of the wave and don't let him stack fury if you're pushing into him

- Rush Plated Steelcaps

- Use the full 4secs of R slow + pull animation to time out his R

'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,286 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E176: Details='EARLY GAME
- Don't fight Tryndamere until minions arrive
- Always start in lane: Don't let Trynda get free fury stacks
- Instantly look to take bush/auto him as he walks up. Don't let him stack fury for free
   - Hold your E, just use your autos. If he spins on you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - If he doesn't spin, push him off CS with your legs/range and get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- You can play really aggressive in this matchup with PTA + Ignite pre-6, but after 6 you have to play a lot more respectful. 
-  His R/sustain counter you from lvl 6-9 just let the wave push into you and farm. They usually hit it a lot to stack fury
- If the wave is pushing out, slow push and build big waves. Stand in front of your minions and try to auto, so he can't stack fury, and hope the wave crashes
- Trade based around his fury:
   - If he has low fury, look to be aggressive and use your Range + Legs to push him off so he can't auto for fury
   - If he has high fury, you have to respect AND HOLD YOUR Q. If he spins on you, use your Q to slow and make space. You don't want to E here or he can run you down/dive you
- Never E forwards if he has ult, high fury, or full HP. Also keep in mind he can E to dodge your E
- HOW TO PLAY THE ALL-IN/DIVE:
   - We want to use the FULL 4s of our R slow + R pull animation to time out his ult
   - Make sure you R him at ~200HP. If R base damage can "kill" Trynda (even if he's in R) it will AUTO PULL. THAT IS BAD.
   - As he dives,  once he's lower: R -> E/Auto to force his R -> Run and let R2 auto time out after 4s -> Pull him in + Ignite -> Hope his R is over
       - Usually Tryndamere will have ~0.5-1s of Ult left, so hit him with an auto and Ignite 
       - MAKE SURE YOU IGNITE AT THE END OF THE FIGHT SO ITS NOT WASTED IN HIS R


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, they will always look to run you down with W slow + Ghost + Lethal Tempo
- Tryndamere has INFINITE SUSTAIN and is hard to all-in because of R. Don't overtrade/OOM yourself with Q/E, just use your Range + Autos
- Tryndamere W is "castable" without needing vision of you. He can tell if you're cheesing in a bush

TIPS
- Try to get Plated Steelcaps first base
- After 9/Black Cleaver you hard outscale for the rest of the game
   - You hard outscale Tryndamere because later on, you do so much damage you force his R in your E flip alone
   - Then you can kite him out easily. You won't kill, but Tryndamere without R IS NOT A CHAMP.'

- If he doesn't facecheck you, it's hard to E due to TF's range. Look to E to gapclose -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- He's really squishy, so if you can trade level 1 he gets oneshot at level 2 with E + F + Ignite + W
- Hard to get prio due to his range, take the bushes and try to match his push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke TF out with Q+Leg Autos until we can E + Flash + R + Ignite at 70%HP
- If he has his card up (W), don't auto, just Q. If he's used it then you can go for a Q -> PTA trade
- Always try to take control of the bush so he can't auto you for free
- Early game his range and damage are quite oppressive, you don't need to force trades. 
    - Level 6 this matchup gets much easier because of your R
- You can buffer E through his gold card, but it still outranges so you won't Flip
   - UNLESS you have a lot of MS, then you can Q->E, but make sure to get really close after Qing and buffer E just as the gold card hits


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-  His damage comes from his E proc, pay attention to when it's up
- Be careful of the Red Card splash damage around minions
- TF has INSANE ROAMS/GANKS with Ghost, his Ult, and Gold card. Really make sure to ping your team so they respect his ganking power

TIPS
- TF is a very summ (ghost/flash) reliant champ, look to punish when they are down (esp if you have Flash up)
- No one really plays AD TF top anymore, but his scaling is still strong if he doesn't fall behind. As long as you hit E + Flash he insta dies though

- Hard to get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- This is an annoying lane, Udyr's R lets him waveclear + trade simultaneously, and his W give him infinite sustain
- Can't really interact, just let him push you in and farm up. You hard outscale
- Pay attention to his Awakened Bar, you can only kill if he's low and not near Awakened W
- Keep your range and don't let him walk up and auto you for free
- Save Phase Rush for when he tries to E stun -> Empowered R you
- It's honestly not worth the mana to Q for damage, you can't really kill until 9/Black Cleaver and he has SO MUCH SUSTAIN

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His empowered E is TRUE CC IMMUNITY, Meaning it denies your R2 pull (and your E)
- His empowered W gives him a lot of health + big shield, be careful to not get baited

- Set him up for a lvl 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill
- Take bush and try your best to match his push, his range gives him level 2 prio usually

HOW TO TRADE
- Really difficult matchup, Varus's base damage is so high he kind of stat checks you at all points
- If he has Bone Plating, PTA, Barrier it's really difficult as he can fight you early with this setup. Try to get behind him and if you can hit E with Ignite you can still win.
- If he has no barrier, you can 1-shot him with E flash at all points.
- Just look for Q poke when you can and avoid getting into his Auto range
- Rush Dirk for the dirk level 6 Ignite powerspike, so you can oneshot from 80/90% HP.
- If  he messes up spacing and you can gapclose with Q->E, look for that. If he doesn't, really important you don't waste Flash as you need it to one shot. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-If you can't manage to get leads on him early, it's really important you respect his level up timers/range. He deals a ton of damage from a long range, and if you take one bad trade it's hard to overcome that HP difference in an all-in. 

TIPS
- You can buffer your E away if he tries to R you
- You don't outscale Varus, but you can always one shot him if you go damage build. Try to establish a kill or take his flash early so he's vulnerable to ganks/E flash, and if you can't just play conservatively until a window opens up.

- DO NOT PUSH IN THIS MATCHUP EARLY, LET HER PUSH YOU IN.  You cannot crash the wave if you try to push

HOW TO TRADE
- Goal is to poke her to 75% with Q, then look for E + Flash + R oneshot
- When Vayne Qs forward, look to trade with Q+PTA
- If you Q first, Vayne can tumble over your Q and take a good trade
- Save your E + Flash for AFTER she tumbles, or she can dodge it
- If you ever hit E, vayne dies, but you can usually only hit with Flash. If you have enough MS, you can Q->E if she tumbles forward. 
- Do not even try to kill her/trade if your Flash is down, just preserve HP and farm

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- YOU CANNOT KILL VAYNE WITHOUT FLASH. You cannot make a mistake in this lane, and you cannot waste Flash
- Really good Vayne's can buffer condemn (E) into your E + Flash. Don't worry about this too much

TIPS
- Edge of Night first is very good into Vayne, as she can only pop it with her E and if her E is on cd you can run her down
- Vayne scales very hard and has no room for mistakes, even from behind she will be trouble. It just comes down to whether you can land the E on her or not.

HOW TO TRADE
- Wincons in this lane:
    - Constant pressure on Vlad with Q -> leg + auto, especially when his Q is on CD (you can see it's CD from his resource bar), to not let him slowly outsustain you with his healing
    - Not letting him empowered Q you
    - Killing with E flash before he can pool
- If you let Vlad play the slow game and push you in/slowly chip at your HP with Q you will be pushed out of lane and outscaled
- Early on try to test how good his reactions are by Eing at him.
    - Pretend you are disengaging and walk backwards after a Q auto trade, he will walk forwards as you walk back, then E him
    - Against competent Vladimirs though, you will only ever be able to E him before he pools with E + Flash (if the Vladimir is good enough to pool this its gg for you)
- At 70%, look for E + Flash + Ignite + R.
    - Even if he is able to cast pool after your E stun wears off, Ignite will tick him down and you can execute when he resurfaces from W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful not to R2 during his pool animation, as it can block R2

TIPS
- Vladimir likes to run straight at you when he gets his empowered Q ms, this is an easy timing to Q poke him

- Level 1 most Warwicks will try to walk up and Q you. Auto -> E -> Auto and they will be half HP and forced to concede prio.

HOW TO TRADE
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in Autos/Legs without letting him Q
- Your autos barely outrange his Q, so spacing is very important as if he trade autos/Q you lose out eventually
- USE YOUR RANGE, PUSH HIM IN, POKE HIM, BUT DO NOT LET HIM Q YOU! You have to space
- If he walks up to CS, Q->PTA/Leg combo 
- You can use your E to small trade, try to flip him sideways rather than behind you.
   - Make space after you Flip so he can't Q easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he does choose to fight you, trading perma without having lethal is good for Warwick - being half HP or below is Warwick's win con
    - Even if it looks like it's going well at the start Warwick wins lane by being unkillable below 25% HP and then just outsustains you
- DON'T GET BAITED. Warwick wants to be low so he gets more damage + healing, and all his healing/tankiness is backloaded with his R/E
    - Also factor in his BARRIER + E
- Be careful of Warwick getting movement speed in lane early due to your team being low on the map

TIPS
- Get Executioner's first base, even if you have Ignite
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in autos without letting him Q onto you. They barely outrange his Q so spacing is very important as if he can get melee range onto you with this scaling setup you will lose
- You hard outscale at 9/1st item and executioners. He's turbo useless in teamfights and his wincon is cheesing lane to get fed'

- Fight level 1, E him if he E's in, but disengage before he gets Conq + passive stacks

- His animation "stops" when you flip the clone, the "real" one gets flipped smoother

- Respect HARD at Level 6, he can run you down

- His Q gives him a lot of range

- Use your range + Q to trade when he CSes, never look to E forwards unless he's in one shot with no clone

- You outscale Wukong by a little bit 1v1, it's always hard and comes down to who plays it better

- You can look to do a small E trade early. If he E's you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Do not prolong the fight, he wins with max Passive + Conq stacks

HOW TO TRADE
- The wincon for Urgot in this matchup is being tanky/healthy enough to hold E until after Wukong W clones during his all ins level 6-8
- Very important to not waste E or panic E if he engages on you, as he can just W clone to dodge it. 
- You need to be very patient and hold your E, Wukong usually has W for dmg: R -> W after knockup ends -> R to have enough damage to kill you
    - If you still have your E up you can threaten E flash ignite R one shot even if you're much lower
    - If you're confident, you can immediately E into his E. If you're fast with it, you can catch him in the E animation before he clones. This is generally risky though so best done later in the game/under your tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Wukong's Q range scales with Q level, and is about the same as your auto range at 9. His main poking pattern in lane is E minion -> Q so watch for this to not get poked down

TIPS
- Ignite early in fights so you cut his conq/passive healing immediately and don't risk igniting his clone
- You can always tell if you E Wukong or his clone, Eing the clone will have a weird "stop" animation and it wont be a fluid E. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN USE R IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FLIP OR NOT
- Outscale at 9/1st item
    - Keep in mind though that Wukong's main strength is his teamfighting, always try to mark him to watch flanks'

- If you pop Yasuo shield passive, can look for Q + PTA trade if he E's near you

- You have to predict Yasuo's dash to hit your E if you want to trade. Usually just E buffer away if he tries to run you down

- His Windwall blocks your entire kit, R1 AND R2

- If he's Q start, you can look to Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage small trade. Try to sidestep his first Q
- If he's E start, he'll dash thru minions. Once you're in range and he wants to dash thru you, E BEHIND YOURSELF

HOW TO TRADE
- Yasuo is a hard matchup as he has infinite dashes to dodge your E, Windwall blocks Q R1 and R2, and shield to win short trades as well while also winning long trades pre-9
- Winning this matchup comes down to being patient with your E, if you hit E you win. 
    - Be aware of your minions to see where he could possibly dash to, try to predict your E to knock him down
    - If you waste your E and he dodges it by dashing through minions you will get run down and die
- Look for E + Flash + R one shot when he's at 60%. 
    - He has to be a little lower than other champs because his windwall will instantly cut off all your damage once he gets unstunned.
- Just let him push you in and farm until you're 9, they usually hit the wave to stack Q


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His windwall will also block your R2 recast, so don't spam R2 unless you can execute him while he's stunned. Try to walk around it so it's not in between you and Yasuo if you can
- Buffering E into his Q3 -> R is really hard. If he tornados you, don't bother buffering E, save it until after his R

TIPS
- Try to take his passive with your leg splash damage
- The 1v1 just comes down to who plays it better/if you hit E post 9

- Never E when he has E1 up. His E2 immunes your flip (he'll still be stunned tho)

- Buffer E into his Q3, but care if its a max range Q3 as that outranges your E

- Buffer E backwards if he R's you

- You outscale at 9+, and generally outscale him the whole game if you're ahead
'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,299 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E206: Details='EARLY GAME
- Level 1 you can look to fight Yone, try to sidestep his Q before looking to E. 
- If he doesn't give E range, sidestep Q -> Leg + Auto is also good
- Should get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades are based around Yone W. Try to bait it out, then look for Q->PTA trades
- Never E Yone if he has E up. You want to buffer E when he Q3's forward
   - Be careful as Yone max range Q3 gives him enough space to click back and dodge Urgot E
- If Yone E > Q3s, just E to force his E snapback, or else he can take a beefy trade. 
   - In general, you never really have windows to E yone unless his E is on CD
- Look to E + Flash + R Yone at 70% HP. 
   - If he has E up to dodge your E FLash,  to make it less obvious, Q/Auto trade -> pretend to run away -> E + Flash when he rechases
- Urgot can buffer Yone R by E'ing BACKWARDS

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Until 9, Yone generally has stronger short trades with W, and long trades with lethal tempo. You can't force trades on him
   - Focusing on farming/going even until then is smart
- Be careful on wasting your E, it's really easy for Yone to re-engage with Q3/E and run you down

TIPS
- You smoke Yone after 9/Black Cleaver. I like going a lethality build after that since Yone is a hard scaling tank shredder, he gets one tapped

- You can look to fight Yorick hard early game, if he respects and starts E just play for level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- EXTREMELY LOW INTERACTION MATCHUP, Yorick just pushes you in post 6 with his infinite ghoul army
    - Sit under tower and farm
- This matchup comes down to sidestepping his E, it's his only ranged tool
    - The hitbox of it grows larger if you try to dodge backwards, but its quite narrow on the sides, so dodge it by side stepping side to side
    - When it's on cooldown you can Q->PTA trade as his ghouls won't auto target you
    - Play at his E max range so if it hits you, you have time to E away before he can cage you
- If he W cages you, your W won't target the cage unless there is absolutely nothing else to hit
    - Don't W and manually auto the cage to get out
- Post 6 it's heavily Yorick favored once he has his maiden, but can look to fight if it dies
- Fortunately Yorick auto pushes the lane with his maidens/ghouls so you can just scale for free
- If he somehow is <60% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Yorick Cage can knockdown and cancel your E.
- You no longer one shot his ghouls
- His Q heals for %missing HP, don't get baited thinking he's low, especially if you have no antiheal

TIPS
- Cull is a strong buy for some sustain in this lane since there's 0 kill potential
- He falls off after lane and you have more value in teamfights. The 1v1 is always difficult if he has maiden though

- Stand behind minions to avoid his Q, use your range + autos to trade. Never let him walk up and auto + W you for free'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,302 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E212: Details='EARLY GAME
- Zac is weak early game, can fight him level 1, especially if he starts W
- If he starts Q try to dodge it, or wait until he slams you to E -> Auto
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Zac's Q cancels Urgot E at every point (casting or buffering), so you have to stand behind minions/dodge it. If he hits it he can full combo you Q->E->W
- Zac has infinite sustain, so we must use our range to trade
    - Q + PTA if he walks up for CS
    - Don't take mindless trades where he can W/auto, he will out sustain you easily. 
- If he E jumps you look to buffer your E on the shadow, then sidestep the followup Q he will throw at you in a straight line
- If played properly, this is mainly a farming lane. Slow push big waves and try to build a CS lead. Zac is quite hard to kill if he doesn't want to die and they almost always will play passive to scale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited into flashing on him early game, his revive blobs are really hard to kill in time if you've used your E/W already
- Make sure you can insta kill if you flash before he Ults, the knockup and heal buy a lot of time

TIPS
- STEP ON THE BLOBS! 
- Rush executioners, Zac's entire 1v1 capability is based around his absurd healing, level 6+ do not try to all in unless you have antiheal
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver/Executioners, and for the rest of the game

- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range
   - Save E > R combo for when he's ~60-70% HP. 
       - Ult won't time out
       - If you insta E, they may insta R, making the 1v1 hard
       - If they hold R, you can 1shot him in the E flip depending on your items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Trundle can cancel your E with his pillar (E) if timed well. 
- Trundle's level 6 is extremely strong 1v1, be very respectful especially if he has ghost + the long lane


TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well
   - If you have enough damage, Trundle gets one shot in your E flip before he can Ult/ramp up'
2025-05-04 23:07:03,316 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG - Received tips for TRUNDLE: Difficulty: Unknown

Quick Summary:
- Wincon is using our range to chunk Trundle to ~60%HP before looking to all-in with Ignite + R

- Maintain your spacing, don't let him walk up and Q you for free

- Use your Q to space if he uses W to run at you

- Don't E forwards pre-9, he can run you down. Be careful in the long lane

- His E can cancel your E, wait for it

- Go full damage build, not tank,you need to kill him in sidelane later

- You outscale in 5v5, the 1v1 is always tricky but you can easily win if you get a lead



Detailed Guide:
EARLY GAME
- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range

- Play around his Q CD to trade

- Flip on his Q2 + E

- Try your best to go even lvl 3-8, he's really strong with Plated Steelcaps

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,978 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E5: Details='EARLY GAME
- Get behind Aatrox and look to fight level 1.
    - Try to bait out the Q1 by spacing max range
    - Walk closer and Auto + E in his Q2 animation (Need to be inner edge of Q2)
    - If you FLIP, click away from Q3 and trade autos/PTA

HOW TO TRADE:
- It's all about spacing and playing around his Q. 
- Goal is to trade with Q/Autos/PTA when his Q is on CD. Repeat until hes ~70%, and you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill.

- You cannot flip Aatrox in Q1 + E, it's too long. Look to FLIP on his Q2 + E
    - Aatrox Q1 + Es forward, sidestep side to side 
    - Q2, click away, then click towards him to try to get him to Q2 + E FORWARDS. This is where you try to FLIP him.
    - Make space so he can't Q3 you after FLIPPING

- This lane is really hard if you can't find leads pre-6/first base, as he can slowly poke you down at range with Q1 + E forever. 
- Only look to E if his E is on cooldown


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Q1 damage is hard to avoid, but does minimal damage. Getting hit by Q2 is a lot more damage, so be careful with spacing/buffering E into Q2
- Good Aatrox's will mix up E'ing forwards on Q2, be careful not to get baited. 
- Hard lane as you have to be very knowledgable if your E hits or not. If you miss E/fail E buffer into his Q, you will take too much damage
- Once Aatrox gets Plated Steelcaps, the MS + armor make it extremely hard to trade back
   - Try to fight hard first 3 levels, if he's not behind and TPs back with Steelcaps it's cooked
- Ignite (or anti-heal) is mandatory if you try to kill him. Have to know lethal limits well in this matchup, as he can heal with Passive + Q above 25% if you try to E flash him

TIPS
- You can "ride" Aatrox W pull by buffering E. Useful in catching them off guard if they're prepping W -> Q under your tower for instance
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver'

- Space her Q if you want to trade 

- Don't E if she has her E up. During all-ins be patient with E W/E and R

- Play to one shot at 70%HP with Ignite + R

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,979 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E8: Details='EARLY GAME
- Akali is weak level 1, get behind her and fight
   - If she skills Q, FLIP on her empowered auto. If she skills E, she will not Q as you walk up, so just use your ranged autos to trade and hold E

HOW TO TRADE
- Once Akali gets her W and E, this matchup gets hard as you can't FLIP until she's used both W and E
- Wiggle around her max Q range, if she misses Q, you can look for small Q/leg/PTA trades. 
   - Repeat until she's ~70% HP and you can look for Flash + E + R + Ignite lethal before she can shroud or E away
      - Ignite can tick her down for 25% ult lethal when she's in shroud
- If she hits Q, use your Q slow to space her - you can't trade back if she drops shroud, and taking poke in this lane is bad
- Only look to play small trades around her Q cd/energy levels (if she doesnt get empowered auto off she can only Q twice) until she's in oneshot range. Respect until then and outscale
- Her W and E have long CDs, so if she wastes them look to trade aggressively

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Post 6, Akali can one shot you from ~80% HP, especially if you're pushed up. 
   - You can't reliably E until she's used her E, W, and R, so it's very hard to live. Really focus on not taking bad trades and be respectful (esp if she has Ignite)
- Never E at her directly if she has E up, she can dodge it with her E easily

TIPS
- Buying MR or HP early (negatron/phage) over AD early is better, as you need to be able to tank her abilities before you can E. AD is not as good early on unless as you can't hit her while she's shrouded
- You can buffer your E into her E2 
- Outscale at 9, and hard outscale for the rest of the game. 
   - You get too tanky to oneshot, and you can just leave W on and chunk her everytime she exits shroud to Q/Auto'

- You can look to fight Akshan level 1, but he has to face check you in bush/walk into E range. 
   - If he respects the cheese, don't overforce it. His range and Q slow can kite you out level 1, and he can trade autos with you early.
- He's very strong early, so just focus on farming/Q poke if he doesn't mess up. Your kill windows are at 6 with Ult + Ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Look to Q+Leg/PTA trade after Akshan uses his Q, the slow from it is what sets up his trading patterns. Without it, he's vulnerable
   - Remember to not stand behind minions as it extends his Q range
   - If he hits Q, run away and try to space him with your Q slow to deny his followup Autos. 
- Repeat until you can set up lethal. He's very squishy so you can E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal at 6 from ~80% HP. 
- Hard to E Akshan without Flash, he has high range + E to disengage. Don't force trades and play around his Q CD

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He hits HARD, so be careful about letting him get the Q + double hit passive + PTA trades on you.  
- His invisiblity makes good roams, so make sure to MIA ping when he's gone.
- Akshan is a very snowbally champ, take care to not die early and fall behind. If he has strong item bases, his trades are unplayable, but if he doesn't get a lead he dies whenever your Flash is up

TIPS
- Go Dirk/AD items first base if you have Ignite + Flash up at level 6. If you're flash is down, build Plated Steelcaps. 
- His E can be body blocked to knock him down, try to stand in his E path if you get on top of him.'

- She has really high CDs, if she wastes her abilities (especially her W shield) or gets too close, look to trade

- Favored at 9/Black Cleaver, you outscale but need to hit your E

- Do not E if she Ults, it will cancel your E

- Really try to fight her level 1, as once she gets level 3+ it's hard to ever hit E.
- Get behind her in the bush and try to PREDICT her Q dash when you E. Getting a good trade in level 1 makes this lane a lot more playable
   - Even if you miss E, you can still win the trade with E shield + PTA/legs 

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is difficult with Ambessa because you can't reliably E until she's used all her abilities. Mainly just try to sustain/minimize trading, she has high sustain and no mana costs so she can poke you out hard.
- Ambessa dictates the trades due to her mobility, play around short Q + W/PTA trades when she's in your range
- When she Q1 dashes in -> Q2 dashes out, stand in your wave.
   - Her Q2 does reduced damage if it hits a minion first, and will push the wave back to you as well
   - You can also look to predict E if she gets in range if you are near your tower. Even if you miss, the shield will help the trade
- She has really high CDs, so if she wastes her abilities (especially her shield W), or dashes too close into your E range, look to trade. If she doesn't mess up though, you don't really have windows to fight back unfortunately.
- Really hard to kill Ambessa pre-9. After 9, you can look to take extended trades while she's in between CDs.
- Don't be afraid to E + Flash to kill, really hard to land E on her normally.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Ambessa R will CANCEL your E, never try to buffer E into her R
- Her shielding, passive omnivamp, doran's shield + grasp, and no mana costs makes her a really insane laner. You have to be very careful with your HP/Mana, if you fall behind this lane gets omega hard.

TIPS
- Ambessa's damage is all up front in burst/shielding, and then she has long CDs. If she's still in range, look to fight, especially post-9. 
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind. You do outscale Ambessa if you can hit E, but she scales very very well too.'

- Aurora is not weak early game due to her passive, but you can still fight her. 
- Get behind her and try to push her into the river. She has high range, so if she doesn't int, just use E to gapclose/shield Auto -> E -> Auto -> Auto (PTA), then disengage.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is based around Aurora Q CD. If she has Q up, you have to respect, as it sets up her passive/electrocute trades too well.
   - Try to bait out her Q at max range, then you can look for a Q + PTA/Legs trade.
   - If she has Q up, only look to Q for trading, don't Auto
- Repeat until shes at ~70% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal.
- I like to take Ignite in this lane as playing small, slow trades usually favors Aurora. You have to all-in, and Ignite + early AD items lets you E + Flash at much higher HP levels. 
   - Ignite also helps as if she has a second to R away, Ignite can still tick her down and get you the kill
- Really important in this lane to not let her get free passive procs off, as it gives her sustain. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- When you E + Flash Aurora, make sure you can kill in the E stun. She has a lot of tools to escape/time out your ultimate.
- Aurora E is actually a buffer, good Auroras can buffer your E with her E. Be a little careful of immediately ulting after E + Flash if they can do this.
- Make sure you don't waste Flash, you have no kill potential without Flash and she can just bully you under tower for 5 minutes.
- She can actually dodge your R2 with her R teleport, but it's really hard to time. Not something you have to really play around.

TIPS
- Keep track of her dashes (W and E), as they have long CDs. If she wastes them you can look to take really aggressive trades. '

- Azir bullies you, outscales you, and is really hard to gank with his dash + R, not much you can do'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,981 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E20: Details='EARLY GAME
- You absolutely have to try to cheese/fight Azir level 1, this is the only level where this matchup is playable
- Get behind him and just try to trade as much as possible. E to gapclose/shield if you can't get in range, this will help you get prio for level 2, then look for E +Flash with Ignite.

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is very difficult because Azir bullies you in lane, outranges you, outscales you, and is also hard to gank.
- You cannot play this lane slowly, Azir will always win.  You have to make it volatile and play for a fast E + Flash + Ignite + R oneshot before he pokes you down too much
- Try your best to avoid his Soldier + Q poke trades, and look to Q poke whenever you can. You will usually take more damage, but you can one shot him from much higher HP.
   - If you can find pockets that his soldiers aren't in, you can look to Q + PTA trade. 
- You NEED Flash to kill Azir. Without Flash he will just bully you for 5 minutes under tower, his range is too high for a normal E. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- You have to give CS in this matchup to preserve HP. If you have no way to reset, be very careful tanking his Soldier + Q combo, as if you get too low you can't threaten all in even with summs up.
- You need your jungler to gank you in this matchup, but it's hard to gank Azir as he has his dash + ult to disengage. 
- Be careful of E'ing in too close to his tower, as he can R you into tower aggro

TIPS
- You can buffer your E into his R, the interaction is a little buggy. If your E connects with Azir as he R's you, you will not be pushed and can flip Azir

- Respect her gank set up + enemy jungle

- Can kill at all points in lane, outscale at 9/Black Cleaver

- Camille's overall scaling is similar to Urgot's, but if you hit E you win'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,983 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E23: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Camille and trade level 1. As soon as the wave meets in the middle, look for an Auto -> E. 
   - If you time the E right, you will flip her before she gets her passive up
   - Don't immediately auto again, look to create space so you can get 1-2 more autos for PTA proc in before she can auto you for her Passive shield

HOW TO TRADE
- Camille's W is the main ability to play around, as she cannot get her passive/Qs on you without the slow. 
  - Whenever her W is on CD, we can trade
   - Q her and run at her -> prepare to click backwards to dodge the W -> once her W is gone, look for PTA/Leg trade
      - The slow from Q and MS from Approach Velocity makes it really easy to bait out Camille W this way
- You can buffer E into camille E, so they can't just force E trades on you.
   - Be careful when Camille's are hovering walls, if they're right next to a wall their E can come out surprisingly fast, making it hard to react E to.
- You cannot let her hit W -> Q1/Q2 with Passive shield combo, you will lose too much HP and then she can threaten lethal. 
- If her passive is down and she is not near a wall, you can look to E and trade hard

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Camille's main strength is her gank setup, MAKE SURE TO TRACK ENEMY JUNGLE and not overextend if you don't have vision. 
- Camille R can dodge your E and your R, so usually you need to buffer your E into her E, or E + Flash her to guarantee your E -> R landing.
   - Camille can buffer her her own E -> R, so if she knows you can E her E, be careful of this interaction
- Camille E (hookshot) can buffer your E if it hasn't "attached" to the wall when she's flipped. If you Flip her AFTER it attaches, it will fizzle and she will die. 
- You CANNOT fall behind Camille in lane, or you can never play as she can engage on you from 2 screens out perma

TIPS
- You outscale Camille at 9/Black Cleaver. Generally you win 1v1 vs her all game, but you have to hit E. 
- Your ignite and R go through her passive shield. You can tick her below lethal with Ignite even if she gets the shield.'

2025-05-04 23:11:07,984 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E26: Details='EARLY GAME
- With Ignite, you can fight her to the death at level 1. It's easier if she starts Q, but you still win if she has E start, as long as you rotate for legs.
- Even if you can't kill her, chunking her is still really good as it sets her up for lethal at level 2 with Ignite + Flash + E

HOW TO TRADE
- Can't play slow trades in this lane, as her Q will eventually poke you out. Play aggressive with your Flash up.
- Even and slightly losing trades are still ok as you can threaten lethal as long as she isn't full HP
- Dodge her Q, then look for Q->PTA small trades to poke her down. If she has Q up, you can Q, but do not go for Autos.
   - If she hits Q, wait out the poison
   - Repeat until she's ~80% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite lethal. 
- Q -> click forwards -> click backwards to try to bait our her Q, they get scared when slowed and you run at them
- Cassio is really squishy at 6 with Ignite, you can oneshot her from really high HP. Just be careful that you don't take too much poke damage. 
- After 6, with enough MS, you can Q -> Run at her -> Buffer E through her R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Do not fight if she lands Q on you
- Be careful of being stunned when near bushes, she can Ult -> W combo you
- Her extended trade is really strong with E spam + Conq, you can't Flip her from full HP, she has to be chunked a little before or she ramps too hard
- Cassio buys a lot of HP (ROA), and even armor sometimes. The matchup gets hard if she hasn't fallen behind and she buys Catalyst first back, as she has too much HP to oneshot now

TIPS
- You can buffer E through her grounding (W) and R, use this to not get caught out. If she can W you, the slow + inability to E will take too much of your HP
- With W on, you can dodge Cassio R by clicking BEHIND YOU. 
   - Visually you'll still face her, but YOU WON'T GET STUNNED
   - Cassio's R stun logic goes off of where your last click was (towards or away from Cass) not your visual model

- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Don't fight level 1 until the minons arrive and crash
- Some Darius's will start W and try to cheese YOU by getting behind you. If he runs from behind you, stand your ground in your wave and Flip him to disengage
- Usually they'll start Q, and try to Q the first 3 creeps, look to space it and get a chunk in. You should always get level 2 Prio as you are ranged.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades in this matchup are based around Darius Q. 
   - Bait it out by wiggling at max range, when it's on CD look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades to chunk him
- Goal is to chunk him to 70%HP before looking for an extended all in. With Ignite and at that HP, he can't get to 5 stacks in time. If you fight 100% to 100% HP, he will have time to 5 stack you and win.
   - But we can only look for these chunks when his Q is on CD
   - Try to freeze lane as much as possible, so we can poke without getting run down
   - When it pushes out, try to slow push. A big minon wave helps if he tries to all in you in the long lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, especially early game, as Darius wants to run you down
- If you miss E, you die
   - Watch out for being in positions where if Darius can just flash your E and then run you down
- If he ever gets a free Q/starts with stacks, don't fight
- Do not Flip forwards aggressively unless Darius is ~70%HP. If he survives at low HP (which he will if >70%HP), he can E->Q with 5 stacks for a gigaheal

TIPS
- You have kill potential on Darius at every stage of the game, but it's Darius favored pre-6. You hard win at 9/Black Cleaver.
- You can buffer his pull (E) with your E, but it's a hard timing to pull off. Try to predict when he'll E you.
   - If you buffer his E you guaranteed win, as he can't get to the outside Q edge.
- In this matchup, missing E is death. Don't hesitate to E flash, as he can easily dodge with flash/ghost. 
- Don't be afraid! You have to stand your ground in this matchup, if you E away defensively you will lose. '

- If you chunk him enough, you can easily E + Flash + Ignite one shot at level 2.
   - Usually Mundo's run Ghost TP, so if they don't have Flash it's guaranteed.

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a neutral scaling matchup, it's not that bad for Urgot as long as you stand behind minions to avoid Mundo's Q/E damage
   - You can't really stop his farming with Q, and he can't really stop your farming if you stand behind minions
- You should never be able to E Mundo as he can outrange with Q, so you can't even take his passive
- Everytime Mundo walks up for CS or misses Q, look for a small Q + PTA/Legs trade to chunk him. 
   - Do the same when he's at his tower CS'ing, just poke him down.
   - He has really low health regen in lane, so damage actually sticks to him
- When Mundo is at ~60/70%, to kill:
   - Lead off with R -> E + Flash with the R slow. The E pops off the passive, then you can circle around and execute with R2.
   

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Mundo passive denies your E AND your R2 pull. 
- Your E does not lock-on your W if he has his passive

TIPS
- You outscale at level 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game if not behind. 
   - Most Mundos stack HP and not armor, so your legs + R %HP damage hit HARD in the 1v1 and in teamfights
- If you have Ignite/anti-heal, Mundo's R at rank 1 barely heals. You can execute him with R easily still.
- His passive has a really long CD early, be sure to step on it if you pop it off

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup comes down to forcing out her Parry (W) with damage, before you have to use your E
- If Fiora has W up, only ever use E when:
   - Predicting E when they go to Q a vital
   - E + Flash
       - When doing this, auto -> walk backwards -> then insta E + flash to not make your intentions obvious
   - Intentionally missing E to bait out the parry
- Whenever Fiora Q's, tag her with a Q + PTA trade on the way out.
   - Important to not miss your Q, as then you can't lock on in the wave and she can hard out trade you
- Try to kite the parry/vitals, if she misses Q (or doesn't get the vital MS) this is your window to trade back
- Level 6+, use R to bait out the parry
   - E is more important to land, especially because parrying E will stun you as well.
- Pre-9, it's 50/50, but you have kill potential if you play it well. At level 9 until 2-3 items, you hard win as she eats every leg trying to proc vitals

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful when Q'ing when she wants to Q a vital, she can Q over your Q and then it's hard to trade
- She can parry your E and both casts of your R
- Be mindful of your vitals, if she gets too many free ones with Q + Grasp, you'll be too low to all-in. Important to not fall behind in this lane due to her scaling

TIPS
- Anti-heal is necessary if you don't have Ignite. Bramble is better early for lane, but executioner's scales harder.
- You can reset bad vitals by walking out of range of Fiora
- Position near walls during her R so you can block a vital by hugging a wall.
- After you E + Flash, unless she's super low, don't spam R2 as Fiora's will spam parry as soon as they're unstunned, and may parry your R2 this way
- Fiora outscales you at 3+ items, she just does way too much damage. Important to establish leads before then.
- You can Ctrl + 3 fake Ult emote to try to bait out her parry (best on pj/butcher skins) (https://x.com/quantelol/status/1729204401838158066/video/1)'

- Level 1, definitely look to fight GP:

    -  If you manage to sneak into the bush and he doesn't see you as minions crash, look for auto + E on GP, then KILL THE BARREL while he's stunned. You can also look to auto the barrel at the start 
    - If he respects the cheese, try to wiggle around the 2nd barrel's chain range to bait it out.  You can E + leg auto to gapclose/shield through the barrel explosion
    - You should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is based around his Barrels (E) and his Q. Always wiggle at 2nd barrel chain range to see if you can bait it out.
   - If he wastes/misses his barrels, look to Flip him, or if not in range for E, a Q + PTA/leg trade is good. 
       - He has an indicator below his HP bar of how many barrels he has left
   - Respect his Q range, especially once he has SHEEN. 
       - Early game his Q only hurts with Grasp up, but after Sheen it is REALLY IMPORTANT you don't let him just perma Q you. 
       - Farm/space with your Q, hide in bushes, don't let him Q you on cooldown. 
       - If he Q's you, try to Q + PTA trade back if there are no barrels around
- GP is really weak without his barrels, if you can pop, dodge, or walk around his barrel radius, you can take heavy trades. 
   - Try to always space far enough out to make him use at least 2 barrels
- When GP is ~60% HP (or if he wastes his Oranges), you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R all in. The ignite is nice as it really cuts his Orange healing. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- HIS ORANGE CAN CLEANSE YOUR R2 EXECUTE. You need to force him to Orange (W) thru damage, before your Ult times out and auto pulls. 
   - This requires high knowledge of your damage. Be sure that if you all-in GP, he's not too high HP and you hold your ultimate for a little so it doesn't time out. 
   - Only press R once! This way it won't auto cast and he can just Orange (W) out. 
- Good GP's will look to Orange (W) your E stun when you E + Flash. Be patient with your R after you E + Flash, because if they orange the E stun they won't be behind you like normal


TIPS
- It's a hard matchup (esp vs Dshield/Grasp GP) until 9 vs good GP, he can just space you perma. After 9/Black Cleaver, and especially at level 13/2 items, you hard beat GP if you hit E. He outscales in teamfights at full build though
- Really really important you don't fall behind after GP gets SHEEN until 9. It's really braindead point and click no counterplay spell, you have to respect and not take too much damage
- At level 9, with no minions around, the matchup gets a lot easier as it's really easy to pop his barrels with W'

- If Garen Q's at you, keep your space and use Q to push him back. Try not to overuse mana

- If they have Conq/Ignite, RESPECT HARD at 6

- You outscale turbo after 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,992 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E44: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to fight Garen really hard early game. If they start E, Auto -> E -> Space their E -> PTA
- If they start W, it's impossible to deal meaningful damage, just look for a PTA proc then drop minion aggro in brush.
- You have complete wave control in this matchup until the wave crashes and bounces back, around level 3

HOW TO TRADE
- If Garen has W up, E'ing into him will always be negative, as even if you win the short trade he will outsustain your HP/mana eventually
- I play this lane by lane-locking garen with my Teleport (with reduced CD from Cosmic Insight), and stacking large item leads on him
    - I don't like to play to fistfight/trade with Garen, as he has infinite resources
    - If we trade hard early game, I'll use my first TP for a Cull buy, else I usually want Phage (1100g) or Pickaxe + Long Sword (1225g)
- Keep your spacing TIGHT. Always keep him at range. If he runs at you with Q, Q him to make space and autos
    - Use your range and autoattacks (no mana cost) in this matchup as much as possible
    - Again, if you try to trade by E'ing at Garen with W, you will just lose out in the long run due to mana costs/lack of sustain
    -  You can look to E the Garen as he Q's at you if he's not as good, sometimes they won't W. Depends on the elo.
- Your Q is only worth the mana to stop his passive from ticking, or to setup a PTA + leg trade. Q alone is not worth the mana for it's damage here
- After flipping Garen, make sure to space a little bit to get out of his E range before following up with Autos
- Always look to stop Garen's passive from ticking, especially if he's lower HP


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Garen cleanses slows with his Q, so make sure you Q him AFTER he Q's when trading
- Keep track of his Phase Rush, it gives slow resists too so if it's active, careful with your R as he'll just run away.
- Garen's love to proxy, especially if they fall behind. Try to keep vision in the river/think to yourself "can he go proxy here?" and stop him from doing so. 
- At 9, make sure you don't turn your W off when he Q (silences you). 
   

TIPS
- You hard outscale Garen at 9/Black Cleaver, you just stat check Garen and lose little DPS when silenced.
- If he has Conqueror + Ignite, you have to be very very respectful level 6+. Taking one trade will put you in lethal range.
   - Conq Garen is USELESS after you hit level 9, and is very weak in teamfights.
   - Phase Rush Garen needs Ignite to kill in lane, but generally has much weaker kill pressure, but scales much harder and can play sidelane later on vs Urgot.

'
2025-05-04 23:11:07,993 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E47: Details='EARLY GAME
- Really important to fight Gnar level 1 after minions crash. Walk behind him, if he starts Q: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA is 70% of his HP, and sets up a really easy E + Flash + Ignite kill
- If they're good, they'll skill jump (E). BE READY FOR THIS AND HOVER YOUR MOUSE BEHIND YOU to prepare for him double jumping off you
   - If you're fast enough you'll still flip him mid-jump
- If you can Flip/chunk Gnar level 1, it makes your game way easier to play
- Even if you can't Flip him, you hard win by just Eing forwards + legs + PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup doesn't start out too bad, but gets progressively worse as Gnar gets more items. Plated Steelcaps, Phage, Q slow + W MS makes it really hard to touch Mini Gnar, and Mega Gnar does too much damage
   - You really want to force his TP before he gets gold for Plated Steelcaps (1200g) as the lane is UNPLAYABLE afterwards, that's why the level 1 chunk is important
- Play around his Q. If it's up you have to respect his range, but if he uses/misses it, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade.
   - Good movement in this lane to dodge Q, especially Mega Gnar Q, is SUPER important. Hitting one Q -> W passive proc lets him chain run you down for a huge chunk
- When he's in Mega Gnar, you have to be very respectful. Just let it time out and look to re-aggro when he's Mini
   - You CAN Buffer E into his Mega Gnar W/R, which is helpful, but he's so over-statted in Mega you can still lose so be careful
- At 60-70%, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot, just know your damage levels as he can double hop (E) out if you don't kill in the stun.
- When you E or E + Flash Gnar, always click to the side so he can't double hop (E) out after the stun expires


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you haven't gotten a lead by the time gnar gets Plated Steelcaps and/or Phage, just play passively and scale. 
   - It's unrealistic to force trades on Gnar with these items
- Be careful of fighting when he's close to Mega Gnar, he gets a lot of HP/resistances
- Be respectful of his double hop (E) on a minion -> transform -> Mega Gnar R -> W combo, it has super high range and can easily kill/chunk you

TIPS
- Gnar scales pretty well, at 9/Black Cleaver is when the matchup becomes even again, but it's not favored. Gnar's scaling is pretty even to Urgot's, it just depends if you can hit E on him while in Mini Gnar if you win or not
- If he's low rage at the start of teamfights, look to focus him before he can transform.

- Look to get behind Gragas level 1 and fight. Gragas usually starts Body Slam (E), so make sure you are READY to buffer E into his E, you can take 70% of his HP if you do
- Should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Buffering your E into Gragas E is the main way you trade in this lane. Always have your E prepared, as you hard win if you successfully buffer it
- If Gragas doesn't E, you don't really have many options. He will stand back and throw barrels (Q) while healing from his passive, it's very low interaction
   - Good movement to dodge his Q is very important, try not to stand on minions so he has to choose between farming or poking
- It's hard for Gragas to walk up melee range to CS, you can Q + Auto/Leg if he does. They will usually farm with barrels
   - If they use/miss their barrel (Q), look to run at Gragas and take a Q + PTA trade. Again, prepare yourself to potentially buffer his E if he slams at you here
- Repeat until he's ~60-70% HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal. 
   - Make sure you know your damage as his R + E can let him escape really easily if not one shot

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Buffering Gragas E is tricky if he's right on top of you. Try to leave some space in between so you have more time to react.
- A lot of Gragas's will look to knock you into tower with R, but you can buffer Gragas R with E
   - Save your E to try to bait out his ult, it's really easy to outplay
- Gragas W auto is AOE, be careful to not stand too close to his target minion for the splash damage

TIPS
- Gragas is annoying in lane due to his Q + passive healing playstyle, but it's not the worst and you hard outscale him in the 1v1, and in teamfights too. Focus on not taking too much poke and farming up
- Cull to match his sustain is really nice in this lane'

- You can look to get behind Graves and fight level 1, they usually start E so hitting your E is hard. Just Auto -> E for gap close -> Auto Auto PTA still wins the trade
- It's a little hard to get prio for level 2 because Graves AOE autos, but try to match his autos. If you chunked him level 1, you can one shot with E + Flash + Ignite at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Graves's game plan is to spam push the wave in, and slowly chip you down with auto/Q poke. He has very low 1v1/trading power
- Look to Q + PTA/Leg trade whenever you can. His Q has a long snapback time, so you can fight even if his Q is up, but definitely look to trade if he Q's the wave
- Only look to E him if his dash (E) has been used. He has no reason to use it as he outranges your E with autos, so it's hard to force it out.
   - Also remember that his E stacks give him armor
- Repeat until hes at ~70% HP, then you can kill with E + Flash + Ignite + R, depending on his grit (armor from E) stacks

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his Q bounce angles, especially under tower. That's his main source of poke damage
- If you E + Flash, smokescreen + E + R are effective escape tools, so make sure you have lethal in the stun


TIPS
- Early Dirk/AD items in this lane feel really nice with Ignite. It's hard to play slow poke into graves (he has fleet + lifesteal usually for sustain), so just threatening the all-in E + Flash immediately is effective
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game, especially with Flash up

- Level 1 walk behind her and fight. If they skill Q, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage is a great trade. 
- If they skilled E and use it to dodge your E, just look for Auto + Leg then disengage

HOW TO TRADE
- Look for Q -> PTA/Leg trades when she has 0-1 Q stacks, or if her Q or E are on CD. Don't let her stack Q on minions for free, always look to sneak in Auto/Qs.
- If she has 3-4 stacks, you have to be careful, dodge side to side so Gwen Q->E won't clip you in the center
   - You can look to predict E when she Q->E's forward ONLY if she's below 70%HP. If she's full HP, she'll win the extended trade with a 2nd Q rotation + Conq
- Never E Gwen if she has E up, she can dodge it easily
   - Make sure if you do E, you hit it. Don't be afraid to E + Flash, if you miss E you die
- If Gwen wastes E and she's below 70%HP, you can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all-in.
   - If she has E up, they can react to E + Flash if they're good and it's riskier
- If Gwen wastes W she's also extremely vulnerable and you can look for trades

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Gwen's Shroud (W) makes this matchup quite hard. Gwen can Q->E with Shroud (W) up so you can't hit back, be careful that you don't click into her melee range trying to click on her
- If you E Gwen from outside the shroud, you'll still Flip. HOWEVER:
   - SUPER SECRET MECHANIC: If Gwen stands on the PIXEL EDGE of her Shroud (W), your E will go through her and die. This mechanic makes the matchup SUPER HARD vs Gwen's that know this.
- Her shroud can block your R2 if you go outside of it

TIPS
- A lot of Gwen's damage is backloaded (Q4, R3), and Urgot's R execute + Ignite is a good way of dealing with that if she's chunked out enough at the start
- Gwen's usually don't take Flash, and the champion is really vulnerable to ganks. Calling your jungler if you have E + Flash up is a good way to kill Gwen
- Gwen is pretty strong in lane nowdays, and scales well. If you snowball you destroy her but she will always be useful if she can get to 3+ items

- Heimer is not a matchup you can fuck with level 1 as his turrets are very strong.
- You can only fight if you have Ignite and he facechecks you, which is unlikely. Just let him push you in

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really low interaction matchup that you can't really look for trades in. Heimer just pushes you in perma, and you get to scale up.
- You can look for small Q poke, but going for Autos is risky as if he grenades (E) you, you lose way too much HP.
- When he grenades (E) you, buffer your E away so you don't tank the charged beam from the towers. 
- Stand behind minions to avoid the rocket (W) poke.
- If Heimer gets low enough or wastes his E, you can one shot with E + Flash + R, but its hard as if he doesn't die within the E stun, you will always die. You can still die even if you kill him as his towers will still hit

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Although it's very unfun, you should be careful of calling your jungler to gank Heimerdinger unless it's obviously free. He has easy 2v1 potential if either of you misplay the gank.
- You can't hit his towers without them hitting you back, your range is too short. 
- He gets lots of MS around his towers, so be careful when Q'ing or E + Flashing
- Be careful of facechecking bushes, he can oneshot you from full HP with some AP

TIPS
- Heimer is a champ that requires lots of kills in lane to be useful later. If you can just farm evenly (or even slightly behind), you'll be 2x his usefulness in teamfights later
- Early negatron/mercs rush is not bad.  You can also play Ignite if you're a Chad and try to kill.

- Definitely want to try to fight Illaoi hard level 1, and pre-6 in general. She becomes impossible to kill post-6 with her R
- Get behind her and look to fight. Try to fight outside of tentacle range, Illaoi W start + tentacles nearby can actually trade with Urgot level 1
- You should get prio. If you don't manage to fight until minions arrive, respect her Q range, or if she isn't Qing be ready to E her W if she W's at you 

HOW TO TRADE
- Illaoi E is the main ability you have to play around. If it's up, especially post-6, you cannot go aggro
   - You can look to trade as hard as you want if she misses it, this is your main window
   - If she hits it, try to exit the tether range ASAP to avoid damage. 
- Always stand behind minions, and try to Q + PTA/Leg trade when she CSes. 
   - You have to be respectful of her Q as well though, have good spacing and don't let her slap you for free
- Illaoi loves to try to hump you under tower, fishing for Es/Qs. This is the only window where you can look to kill Illaoi with E + Flash + R, as she self stuns with her ability animations, and it's easy for her to get tower aggro
- You can kill pre-6 with Ignite, but after 6 it's entirely Illaoi favored

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Illaoi's ult makes her displacement immune, meaning if well timed she can immune your E flip. If the Illaoi is good, you'll almost always have to look for a E + Flash to kill
- Illaois like to Q/W + tentacle the wave to insta kill your minions, opening you up for a surprise E. Be careful for this
- The tentacles still slap, even if you kill them
- Be careful of calling your jungler to gank Illaoi unless its for sure free, she can easily 2v1.
   - Both of you have to dodge the E if you want to gank

TIPS
- If she has no tentacles when she grabs your E, it won't do anything really. You don't have to exit the tether range and can stand your ground and trade back
- Illaoi is a champ that can only lane, unless you have 5 melee champs. She's useless in teamfights so going even and scaling up is a win for Urgot
- The "scaling" in this matchup is dependent on if you dodge Illaoi E or not, she will always be able to kill if she hits it'

- If Irelia doesn't appear until the minions are low, be careful of her dodging your E by QQQ'ing the first 3 minions -> Q you with full passive
   - In this scenario, try to predict your E into her Q on the minions
- If Irelia starts E, try to zone her off the first 3 EXP. If she walks up you fist her

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is determined on how many stacks she has/she can get: 
   - When the wave is pushing into you, show respect pre-9, she has max stacks 
   - When the wave is pushing into her, you have to be careful. Try to walk AHEAD of your wave and fight her so she can't dash around thru your wave
   - MAKE SURE YOUR WAVE CRASHES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK IRELIAS FREEZE 1v1
- If she E->Q's you, E behind yourself, not at her, or it will miss
- HOLD YOUR E UNTIL GUARANTEED. They will always try to bait it out with Q dash. 
- If she wastes W, you can look to play aggressive, they usually use it to setup the minion wave to Q through, so be careful  you don't miss E
- You have to stand your ground and fight with Ignite in this matchup, if she can fight you in your minion wave and win you can't play the game


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very patient with your E, always pay attention if she's trying to bait it with a minion to Q to. 
- Her W gives her damage reduction, so don't ult too early if she negates your E damage with W
- She powerspikes hard on BORK and Plated Steelcaps
- If she gets a freeze on you pre-9, hopefully your jungler comes to help, but if not look to roam or put pressure on the map. YOU CAN'T BREAK IT SOLO

TIPS
- This is a very difficult matchup vs good Irelias, and if you make one mistake they can freeze on you forever. 
   - Really focus on playing aggro first 3 waves, and then respecting afterwards if she doesn't fuck up
- You turbo outscale Irelia, especially in teamfights, as long as you get your EXP you're fine.
- Can rush bramble vest + plated steelcaps yourself if you fall behind, your base damage at 9 can stat check her hard

- You can fight him level 1, just save your E to buffer his E.  
- If you take the brush, Auto -> E -> Space out his E while he's stunned -> Auto Auto PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane pre-9 you always want to play for the freeze. Jax wants the long lane to run you down with max passive stacks
    - Never fight when the wave is pushing into you
    - Jax has a hard time breaking freezes and will eat a lot of damage while being vulnerable to ganks.
    - Very important to look to poke Jax while wave is frozen so when it bounces out you can kill him before he ramps his stacks up
- Very E cooldown-based matchup, whoever E's first loses. Always Buffer your E into his E
    - If you E his E, always click away to not get stunned before Autoing again
- Your Q is also super important, when he jumps on you -> Q under yourself to make space -> Land E
   - Jax's model places him "in" you, so if you E forwards immediately it won't connect
   - Also be careful that he can jump over your Q and then trade
- If he jumps on you with E, buffer it with your E -> Q -> PTA trade and you win. 
   - You can also just E if you can make a tiny bit of space between you guys, usually you have to E backwards/to the side.
- If he jumps on you without using E, Q -> PTA trade, and hold your E
- You can look to all in from 70% HP if you buffer his E, Ignite + R kills him easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Jax's will know you want to Buffer E into his counterstrike (E), and will try to sidestep in their E animation
- When Jax has passive + grasp stacks up, you have to respect. 
- Keep in mind Jax's minions when he walks up with E. They'll try to bait your E, then Q to their minion out of range
- Spacing is super important in this lane, don't let him W + Grasp trade with you for free. 
   - You need an HP advantage pre-9 to trade, or else he can just all in you before you can kill. 
- If he manages to stun you while you flip him, be careful in buffering your R, as he can jump away to dodge it once you're both unstunned

TIPS
- You have kill potential at every point during this lane as long as you're not in the long lane.
- Ignite really helps in this lane as it goes thru his counterstrike (E) 
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver for the rest of the game

- Look to fight Jayce level 1, if you manage to Flip him it makes the lane significantly easier
- Most Jayce's start E or Q, try to push them into the brush and ignite early for vision. 
- If you can Flip/chunk Jayce, level 2 prio -> E + Flash is an easy solokill

HOW TO TRADE
- When facing Jayce:
   - Stay behind minions to dodge his ranged Q
   - Use the brush/respect his auto range to not let him get free autos off
- Just look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades if he enters your range. Use your Q slow to push him off if he's trying to auto you a lot
- If he fucks up his spacing you can even look to Q -> E combo, but be careful of doing this if he's full HP, or you don't have Ult/Ignite. Jayce does a lot of damage if you can't finish him off instantly
- You usually will never have the range to normal E Jayce. Only if he melee Qs into you can you look to E
- Jayce MS gate (ranged E) and knockback (melee E) give him insane self-peel, it's really easy for him to kite you. Missing E/Q can lead to a really bad trade
- With Ignite and early AD items, you one shot Jayce from ~75%HP with E + Flash. Can give CS to avoid taking poke until he's in kill range
   - Because of Jayce's oppressive poke, it's important to look to one-shot before he can slowly poke you down
- When he transforms from Melee -> Ranged, this is a good window to look to all-in as he can't melee E (knockback) for a couple seconds
- You can buffer E into Jayce E, but you have to predict it as it roots you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Jayce's main poke tool is his QE from range, try to walk in random directions when you don't have a minion wave to cover you (like when you're CS'ing under tower)
- Jayce will often look to melee Q your minions, and hit you with the AOE damage. Be respectful of the melee Q radius if you stand too close to your wave
- Jayce has built in mana refund, and sustain with Dblade/biscuits, so his resources are deceptively high

TIPS
- Jayce is a really annoying lane bully, and the better the Jayce the more annoying. I've tried many setups into Jayce like Plated Steepcaps rush + play passive, but I think the best strategy is GIGA AGGRO level 1, and build Dirk/Pickaxe/Long Swords and try to just E + Flash + Ignite instantly. 
   - Cheesing Jayce early is so important, as he has 6 abilities at level 3 and you can no longer trade favorably
   - Playing slow is also just hard vs good Jayces, they can space your Q/E too easily and he has such insane poke
- Playing for level 6 spike (you get an ult, he doesn't) is a good strategy
- You beat Jayce at 9/Black Cleaver and outscale 1v1 and in teamfights the rest of the game'

EARLY GAME
- If Kalista facechecks you in a brush early, you can fight, but generally respect and give her range. Her hop is too OP at kiting level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- It's pretty impossible to trade with Kalista, if she doesn't walk into your E range early game focus on giving cs and PRESERVING HP
- If you can predict Q into her hop, look for a small Q + PTA leg trade
   - This chunk can set her up to be killed at level 2/3 with E + Flash + Ignite
- If she's full HP, just focus on not taking too much poke and hitting Q/Legs when you can, don't overforce trades.
- If you haven't found a lead early game, rush Dirk/AD Items and try to one shot at 6 from ~80%HP with E + Flash + R + Ignite
- Kalista usually perma pushes and is very vulnerable to ganks. If you can't find leads 1v1, just make sure you save Flash for jungle ganks
- Never E at her in front of her, only E + Flash. She's too high range to ever hit a normal E 
    - Very important to not lose Flash as you need it to exist in the lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Care for her Q poke + E resetting on minions to chain slow/auto you poke
- Pay attention to her "hop rythm", if she keeps dashing in one direction look to predict poke with Q where she hops

TIPS
- It's a hard lane, but a very uncommon pick. Only really insane Kalista players can pilot Kalista well enough to make it work.
   - It has to get a lot of kills in lane to be useful later on
   - Kalista top also griefs the enemy draft hard usually
- Kalista gets crippled by CC, so playing around your jungler and trying to make it to teamfights is a very viable strategy

- Level 1 Karma is really strong with R+Q. If she doesn't facecheck you and respects your level 1, just play lane standard
- Stand behind minions to avoid R+Q, it's so much damage early game

HOW TO TRADE
- Very hard to trade with Karma as she outranges/pokes you, and has a shield/MS to deny your Q
   - Just stand behind your minions to avoid Q damage
- If she wastes her empowered R ability, or her shield, you can look for a small Q + PTA trade to chunk her. 
- Generally, I don't look to interact much in this matchup. Conserve HP, play for a Dirk/Pickaxe first base
   - Then at 6, I look to E + Flash + Ignite + R  oneshot after she uses R+Q to poke
   - You have to wait for her to use R, if she has R + W it heals too much and can prevent your ult from executing
- Once you get some levels and MS going, you can Q- > E combo her. If you hit Flip you hard win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited by her HP if she has R + W up, it heals a lot.
- Her R + Q has extended range, so be careful not to get caught at the max range

- Karma Top only exists to give cancer to melee champs, it doesn't really do anything post-lane

2025-05-04 23:11:08,002 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E80: Details='EARLY GAME
- It is critical you fight Kayle level 1. Get behind her, Flip her, and try to zone her off the first 3 creeps of EXP
- If you chunked her enough level 1, you can look for a dive on the 2nd/3rd wave as you crash into tower.
   - If not, play to setup a freeze/gank angle as the wave then bounces back into you. 
      - Kayle is so weak at this point in the game that you can just walk behind the wave and zone her/fight her 1v1, denying her even more EXP

HOW TO TRADE
- Denying Kayle pre-6 is really important for how trades play out in this lane post-6
- Always look to Q -> E pre-6 Kayle, but focus on not hitting the wave too much. 
   - You want the wave to be pushing into you so you can deny/zone off EXP and setup ganks, which is more important than the trades
   - If you deny enough EXP, you can freeze the wave when you're 6 to her 5, which is huge
- Once Kayle hits 6, it's much harder to hit Q. Still look for Q + PTA/leg trades if you can, but they're rare, especially if she rushes T2 boots
- You can still E + Flash on Kayle post-6 if you have Ignite + AD items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kayle R can block your R2 pull, and in general they will R as you E + Flash to deny burst
   - If you E + Flash, try to see if she insta ults before immediately W'ing + R. If she does, hold off a bit on your burst until it times out.
- Watch out for Kayle's Q thru the minions, and E poke. The damage from these add up
- T2 boots + max passive stacks (gives MS) + W MS make her extremely fast in lane, don't disrespect and miss your E

TIPS
- If you can't find leads in this lane pre-6, don't overforce until level 9. It feels bad, but Kayle will bully you until you get 9/Black Cleaver, so just focus on going even until that spike again
- Kayle outscales you again around 3 items/level 16, so try to close it out early. Her R is a very powerful tool to deny your R

- If he respects your cheese, you can try to trade autos + Legs + PTA by just E'ing forwards to gapclose
- Should get prio for level 2 if played right

HOW TO TRADE
- The main ability to watch out for is his shuriken (Q). Stand behind minions to dodge it, and look for Q + PTA/Leg trades if he gets in range
   - Only look to Q -> Auto if you can't get hit by his Q. If you can, only Q to poke
   - Generally it's hard to look for Q as his Q outranges yours
- Repeat until he's 65%HP, then you can look to E + Flash + R one shot
   - He has really insane escape tools with his W MS and Stun, so make sure you have lethal on the Flip or he will escape fast 
- RUSH MERC TREADS. With merc treads, if he's slowed by Q, you can Q -> E combo usually even if he gets W speed and still Flip. The tenacity helps a lot too, as it lets you buffer E before you get stunned. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his passive stacks on you (3 = stun), if he can Q -> W -> Stun, he can Q you again as you are stunned, which is too much HP to lose
- His empowered auto + W combo hurts, give CS/respect until he uses the empowered auto to CS
- Kennen is a really OP teamfighter. Try to always mark him, or ward flanks/keep track of his flash, Kennen R + Flash can insta win teamfights

- You can fight Kled early in a small trade, but don't extend. You don't have the damage to kill level 1, and he will get too much free courage if dismounted
- Fight as the minion wave arrives. Look to sidestep his Q and trade Autos
   - If he hits Q, E TO THE SIDE FOR THE SHIELD, and auto with legs/PTA. It's risky to flip forwards INTO HIM level 1, as he can trade autos with you, dismount with Conq stacks, and then get a lot of courage to remount before you can kill.

HOW TO TRADE
- The key to this matchup is not dismounting Kled until your E is up
   - If you start off the trade with E, don't dismount him. Don't auto attack him, just walk away to buy time for your E CD
   - If he's able to start the fight at like 30-40% courage he can almost always remount before you can kill, especially if he has his W up.
   - Once Kled is dismounted, E + Flash + W + Ignite is a guaranteed kill
- When you trade, it's important you don't dismount him without the ability to kill, or else the next fight he will remount and gain way too much HP to ever fight again
- Look to sidestep his Q, then go for Q -> PTA/Leg trades. 
   - Try to also tether at max Q range, that way even if he hits it you can walk away from it before it yoinks you (the yoink does way more damage)
- If he wastes W on a minion, you can look to trade 
- Only look to Flip Mounted Kled in this matchup if he's chunked ~60% HP, that way you can kill with R + Ignite before he remounts
- Try to R him right before he dismounts, as he gets a smaller hitbox + Q dash and is harder to hit with R
- Your E can "ride" Kled Q for a guaranteed flip (as long as he doesn't E away). 
   - This is useful when Kled looks to mounted Q you while in his dismount animation, you can ride the Q with your E -> R -> kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kled has one of the strongest level 3's in the game, be respectful of his E -> Q -> W combo
- A lot of Kled's will not level their W until they need it to remount, don't get baited
- Be careful when you E + Flash + R when he's almost dismounted, he goes invulnerable as he dismounts, so your R can miss
- Dismounted Kled's Q is actually a buffer, good Kled's can try to counterplay your E with this
- If you R Kled as he remounts, his remount invcan deny your R2
- Kled R gives him really strong roams/ganks on mid lane, make sure to ping his location


TIPS
- Your E can buffer his R for a guaranteed flip
- Kled needs kills in lane to be useful, you OMEGA outscale Kled as the game goes on.
- Kled players rely on knowing when to remount better than you do to get kills. Don't play into this, only dismount when you have E -> R combo up for guaranteed execute'

- Generally don't try to overtrade level 1, K'Sante has so much regen with DShield, and you have very low kill potential, the damage won't matter much. Focus on CS'ing 

HOW TO TRADE
- You can only trade with K'Sante pre first base. Once he gets any amount of armor, any trade is negative for you. 
- You can never really go aggressive in this lane, just trying to outscale and be more useful in teamfights
- As he goes for CS, look for small Q + Leg poke. Be respectful of his Q range, and his E -> Q range as well. If Q's a minion, you can look for longer trades
- You can buffer your E into his Q3 knockup
   - Be careful with this, as they can W or E to counter your E buffer if they know about it
- Once he gets his first armor item (Chain Vest) HE IS OMEGA HITLER. He can dash (E) at you in your own wave and still win the trade. 
   - Preemptively click down to dodge his E->Q combo
- You can never E at him if he has W or E up. 
- You can buffer E into K'Sante W (make sure your E hits during the dash, not the channel). The timing on this buffer is a little tricky as he can change how long he holds W
   - This interaction makes it hard for K'Sante to ever ult you/force the all-in, as you can phase rush to safety during the stun
- Just try your best to interact minimally and keep your farm even. K'Sante is one of the few champs that can beat Urgot at 9/Black Cleaver

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always be mindful of your Phase Rush cooldown, if it's down it's really easy for K'Sante to Q -> W -> R chain slow you down, especially with Icebourne Gauntlet
- A good K'Sante can buffer his R into your W, so even if you E buffer his W, he can W -> R and cancel your E 
- If he Q3's you under your tower, you have to E AWAY FROM HIM, or else he can W-> R you over the wall
- He has no mana costs in Ult form, so don't get baited by him appearing OOM
- Watch your positioning near walls when trying to trade/gank K'Sante. Don't give him a R kidnap angle if your jungle ganks

TIPS
- Outscaling K'Sante in the 1v1 is really hard, even at 9/Black Cleaver.  His W is hard for Urgot to dodge, but he's much clunkier in teamfights and falls off hard then compared to Urgot
- His W does not immune him from your R2, it will just delay the pull until his W animation completes'

- You cannot E him if he has W up + minions nearby to dash to
- If he ever Q -> Q2s you, you can E into him and chunk him hard. They usually won't do this though unless it's guaranteed lethal
- You can buffer E into Lee Sin kick (R), the timing is a little tricky though. Pay attention on ganks/trades when they make it obvious they want to kick you
   - Especially if they Q onto you while getting ganked, be ready to E backwards if he tries to ward hop -> R behind you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

TIPS
- This pick isn't very common anymore, and it's rather weak. It's hard to win lane as he's very slippery and has high sustain, but you omega outscale him in the 1v1 and in teamfights.

- If he ever walks into E range you win. You hard win if he has Grasp instead of Comet

- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, but need AP to kill him in teamfights'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,006 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E95: Details='EARLY GAME
- Malphite is really weak level 1, look to get behind him and fight. If he does not facecheck the bush and get into E range, careful to not let him just Q you for free and run away with the MS
- If he has E start, look to Auto -> Flip -> Make space so he can't E -> Auto -> Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- If Malphite ever gets in E range, look to flip, especially if you have legs/equal items
- This is a poke lane, try your best to use TP + Cull + Dblade + Pots to stay health enough to eat farm until 9/Black Cleaver
   - Really important to save your TP to reset for when he pokes you out too hard.
- Malphite will max range Q + Comet you on repeat until you're in lethal. You can't really interact since max range Q + MS lets him kite your E
   - TAKE CONTROL OF THE BRUSHES, don't let him Q you for free. Make him work for it.
   - Early on, E for the shield + Auto + Leg whenever he walks up to Q you
   - You're playing to outsustain his mana pool
- If he has no Q, you can look to Q->PTA/Leg trade, or even Q->E Flip. Careful if you flip pre-9, Malphite in the long lane with armor (Warden's Mail, etc) can run you down and kill you
- Once you break his shield, try to hit him with autos to keep it ticking. Be careful of overusing mana in this lane, as you can't really kill.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Malphite is really hard to kill after his first base for armor. Try to get as much of a lead as you can before then.
- Malphite is really strong level 6+ with an Armor Component, don't ego and just focus on keeping your farm up
- If Malphite rushes Thornmail, it's really hard to win 1v1, even at Black Cleaver. Pray you have AP Carries and play to eat farm + teamfight, not 1v1

TIPS
- Level 1-2, Malphite Q costs a ton of mana and only is worth for him if he has Comet + Manaflowbind up. Stand in front of him and try to baitt him to Q you when those are down 
- If Malphite goes grasp, it's a free win. If they have to actually auto/enter your E range, you can hard win trades
- Don't toggle at level 9+ if he has E attack speed slow on you
- It's hard to kill Malphite, but it's hard for Malphite to kill you, and you outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver. In teamfights, as long as you have some magic damage, you're more useful
- His ult cannot immune Urgot R2, it will execute him after the animation

- Trade when he misses Q, you can E buffer thru Q

- If he Ws you, E behind yourself to flip him as he becomes targetable

- Hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver and for rest of game. 

- Maokai has insane teamfighting, so play sidelane'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,008 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E98: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Maokai and trade hard, buffer his Q with your E if you can get close enough. 
- Try to deny the first 3 EXP or CS, you should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Maokai is short range, just play around his Smash (Q). 
- Wiggle around his max Q range, it's a bit longer than your auto range. Look for Q->PTA/Leg trade if he misses/uses Q
   - Usually Maokai CS'es with Q, so look for trades everytime he does so. USE YOUR RANGE
- You can look to Q->E combo Maokai and buffer his E through his Q. Make sure close the gap as much as possible before Eing, it makes it easier to buffer E
- If he ever Roots (W) you, E BEHIND YOURSELF to Flip him after he becomes targetable again
- Don't let him get free Grasp + passive autos and free Q poke on you, and he has no tools to fight back. 
   - Deny him CS and outscale


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Maokai W can dodge your E and your R, be careful E'ing Maokai normally. 
   - If his W is up, E + Flash or look to BUFFER E THROUGH HIS Q
   - Also do not R Maokai unless he's E stunned, or wait for him to get out of range so he has no W targets
- Maokai has really nice gank setup, get vision out after you crash waves to not die to jungle
- From 7-9, Maokai (with 4 points Q) with armor items/bami is actually strong, respect until 9

TIPS
- This is a relatively easy tank lane, he has a lot less laning pressure than most tanks but better scaling. 
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, and decisively win 1v1 the rest of the game. However, his teamfight power is better than yours so really look to establish AT LEAST a CS lead in lane
- Try to play side lane vs Maokai later on as he wants to only teamfight

2025-05-04 23:11:08,009 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E101: Details='EARLY GAME
- If you have Ignite, you can look to fight Mordekaiser early. 
- However, Mordekaiser lvl 1 is no joke. You have to get the jump on him Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA, and kite with your legs. 
   - His passive + Conq + 2nd Q cast can make it a close fight
- Usually, just look to E thru the first 3 melees and FLIP Mordekaiser as he Qs them -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage 
   - If you can Flip him here into a chunk, it's huge for your lane
- Should get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- After the first 3 levels, Mordekaiser stat checks you until 9/Black Cleaver
- Your goal is to not contest/play aggro unless he's ~60% HP and in oneshot E + Flash + Ignite + R range. 
   - Look for small Q/Leg poke, but do not E forwards or play too aggro when he's higher HP.
   - His shield + Conq makes him really tanky after your E burst, you usually can't kill and then he ramps up and kills you
- Play around his Q, wiggle around its range and try to bait it out. 
   - If he uses/misses Q, look for a short Q->PTA/leg trade. 
- If he ever wastes shield (W) you can look to heavy trade/all-in if hes ~70%HP
- If he holds shield (W), hold your E in all-ins until hes around ~40% HP so you can burst him below execute 25% range during your E stun. 
   - Even if he shields after, your R will still execute him
- If he ever E's you and you can't dodge it, buffer E away 
   - You can "ride" his scoop (E) with your E, useful in flipping him under tower if he doesn't know

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL IN THE LONG LANE. Mordekaiser can just walk up -> R -> EQ  and force the all in from Full HP. Even if he can't kill you, you will lose way too much HP
- Mordekaiser shield (W) makes him deceptively tanky, be patient with your R after you Flip as he can time it out easily
- Use your Flash to dodge one of his Qs if he all-ins you
- Be careful of him using his Ult to trap you and setup a jungle gank

TIPS
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you, you literally can't fight pre-9 if he's equal pre-9
   - If the wave is pushing away from you, STAND ON YOUR MINIONS and bait him to Q you to push it back
- You can actually complete your R2 as he ults, you can yoink him out of his death realm (R)
- Really difficult lane, but it's Urgot favored at 9/Black Cleaver if you play the fight well. After level 13 and 2 items you hard outscale Mordekaiser for the rest of the game.
   - Mordekaiser is also not a great champ, he's really weak to ranged/kiting. If you fall behind, don't worry if your comp isn't 4+ melees.'

2025-05-04 23:11:08,011 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E104: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Nasus and fight level 1, ZONE HIM OFF THE FIRST 3 MELEE EXP. 
- If he walks up past you, try to flip him back towards his tower and PTA chunk for 70% of his HP
- If you chunked hard, look for E + Flash + W + Ignite kill at level 2. If there is no angle, look to freeze/setup a gank after the wave crashes then bounces back
   - As it bounces back, you can walk behind the wave (make sure you don't have minion aggro) and fight/zone off Nasus again
- Trading/deny EXP level 1 is critical in this lane, or else you can't punish Nasus pre-6.  You want to either take his HP and TP, or make him lose EXP.
   - Once he hits 6 the matchup gets really hard in an isolated 1v1 without a lead.

HOW TO TRADE
- Pre-6, if Nasus ever walks up, look to Q->E->Trade as hard as possible. 
- After 6, only look to Flip if hes ~60%HP and you have Ignite/items. His R is an insanely powerful 1v1 tool
   - Just look for Q->Leg/PTA trades until he's low enough to all-in
- Usually Nasus goes 3/4 points E with Dring/Tear, and just stands 10 screens back wave clearing.
   - Not much counterplay to this strat, do your best to dodge the E (impossible challenge)
   - MAKE HIM CHOOSE BETWEEN E'ING YOU OR THE WAVE: Stand on the side of the lane, and look to Q->Trade if he E's the wave
   - Preserve your HP vs this setup: don't overly force the freeze if your jungle isn't nearby
   - His stacks are low with this setup, but he can get CS/EXP. 
- If you haven't found a lead pre-6, play to just farm up until 9/Black Cleaver when you beat Nasus again.
   - Even if you found a lead, you can still easily lose at Nasus 6 + Sheen, focus on growing your CS lead, or chunking him out hard if you want to all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If Nasus runs Phase Rush, respect the cooldown before looking to all-in/R, as it also gives slow resist after
- Nasus R gives him lots of Resists + HP, so don't R too early or it will time out
- His wither (W) slow is really strong at setting up ganks, don't overextend looking too hard to trade

TIPS
- Don't toggle W if you are withered, just leave W on
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver, but eventually in the 1v1 he outscales depending on his stacks.
   - But your teamfight is much better than his due to Urgot's CC, just focus on E/Ring him when your team can focus him down

- You can really fight Neeko level 1 if she facechecks/gets near the bush
- If she has Q start, you can look to Auto -> E to gap close/shield -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage for a nice chunk 
- If she has clone (W) start, it's a little trickier as she can run out of your auto range. If she starts Dblade, she will usually start clone (W). You can still fight tho, just try to hold your E to bait out her W first
- If you can't trade level 1, focus on using brushes to avoid autos and match her push as best you can

HOW TO TRADE
- Neeko's high range/poke makes this matchup hard, you can only poke with Q
- Do your best to avoid her Q/E/Empowered W Auto
   - If she misses/uses E, you can look for a Q->PTA/Leg trade
   - If she has E up, try to dodge her Q and look for Q poke in return
   - Stand in brushes/respect when has empowered W auto up
- If you can poke her down enough, look for E + Flash + R + Ignite one shot
- I like to go early Dirk/AD items + Ignite in this matchup so I can flash her from high HP. Playing slow lets her poke you down too much, her Q is really hard to dodge
- If you're fast with E + Flash, you will still Flip her even if she clones as you Flip
- If you Flash to kill, make sure you have lethal. Her Clone + E + R can time out/disengage easily, and without Flash you can't play the game for 5 minutes

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful overextending a trade, as her W clone + MS can outrange you easily
- Neeko W can bodyblock your R and E

TIPS
- Count the minions to see if she's invisible, press tab and if her portrait lights up but you don't see her, she's disguised somewhere
- Always remember that if you "see" the enemy jungle on minimap, it could be Neeko. Don't think you're safe from jungle ganks.
- You can buffer E through her E and R
- You hard outscale AP Neeko in the 1v1, but AD/on-hit Neeko is a little more tricky. If you don't have a lead, be respectful of AD Neeko's damage/scaling, but you're much more useful in teamfights '

- Level 1 look to fight him before minions spawn, BUT DO NOT FIGHT PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE
   - Auto -> Try to get behind him and E him towards his tower -> Auto -> Phase Rush and disengage
   - If you look for anything more, he can ghost/Q chain slow you and win, as his Ghost lasts longer than Phase Rush
- If you don't fight before minions arrive, look to E Flip him as he CS'es the first 3 and Phase Rush away
- You should always get level 2 prio. Trading hard level 1 sets up a level 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill, which makes this lane A LOT easier

HOW TO TRADE
- You are actually stronger in this matchup pre-6, but once Olaf hits 6 NEVER INTERACT UNTIL 9/Black Cleaver
- Pre-6, look to use your range and Q+Legs to trade hard. 
   - Don't commit your E unless he's low enough to burst in W with Ignite, he gets too much lifesteal + shielding at low HP
   - If he's ~30-40% HP, and you have Ignite + Legs up, you can look to commit to an all-in 
- If Olaf has Ghost/TP, play for prio and call your jungler to gank when the wave bounces back. He has no counterplay to your E + Flash, and then you get his TP on a frozen wave
   - If Olaf has Ghost/Flash, can do the same play, they usually won't react to E + Flash. 
      - Look to kill, or at least chunk and force him to base on a frozen wave with no TP
      - Be a little careful, as if you Flash too early and he's not low enough, he can trade 1 for 1
- If he throws his axe (Q) too far away, look for a Q->Leg trade, he has no all-in threat if he can't pick up his axe
- Post-6, always look to hold the wave and freeze. Be careful when the wave is pushing out. OLAF WANTS THE LONG LANE TO GHOST/Q YOU DOWN IN AN ALL-IN
   - If the wave starts pushing out, stand in your minions and bait him to Q so it pushes back to you
   - Never walk into his Q range unless you have PHASE RUSH up
- Most Olafs will panic R when you R them if they're in execute hp. 
   - Hold your R2, Olafs ult will time out and then you can R2 him in for the execute
- Try to bait him to all in you, then use Phase Rush/E to disengage. He is much weaker without his Ult than you post-9
- You can win at level 9/Black Cleaver vs Olaf if you have Ignite + get the first jump on him, but you will lose if he can instantly melee range/fight you. 
   - Use your range + Phase Rush movement speed to space him

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Olaf R prevents you from E'ing or R executing him, which is why this matchup is hard
- He gets increased lifesteal/shielding when low, you NEED ANTI-HEAL (Ignite or item) to kill at any point in the game
- His ult lasts for as long as he can auto, so try to disengage ASAP to let it time out
- It's often not worth to get your jungler to gank Olaf until 9/Black Cleaver, you don't have any damage/CC thru his R and he can 1v2 easily


TIPS
- You can use Ignite for Nimbus Cloak MS as another disengage tool if your Phase Rush is down
- Olaf R costs 100 mana, so he runs into a lot of mana issues nowdays if he spams axe (Q). If he has <100 mana, can look to E + Flash + R even when he's 6
- You CAN win past 9 if played well, but it's still a 50-50. Unless you're ahead, Olaf's 1v1 is always strong vs Urgot, but his teamfighting is much worse usually.
   - Focus on getting through lane even, then being more useful in 5v5s'

- Look to fight Ornn level 1 with Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA disengage. 
- Ornn doesn't really take a lot of damage, so focus on CSing over trading in this lane after the level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- Interacting with Ornn before 9/Black Cleaver is always negative. We can never flip forwards in this lane, just farm up and outscale
   - His ability to build items in lane means you have to preserve your TP and TAKE RESETS WHEN YOU CAN
   - He only takes damage before he buys, once he has any armor component/bamis he is exodia
- His Q is his main poke ability + sets up larger trades with Q->E. Focus on dodging the Q damage and move away from the pillar immediately
   - Ornn's will usually throw Q to CS, so don't stack on top of your minions
- If Ornn ever looks to Q->E combo you, be ready to buffer E away to deny an extended trade from him
- Ornn breath (W) will deny your Flip, but HE WILL STILL BE STUNNED AFTER. If you E -> Ornn Ws, insta click away while he's stunned so he can't brittle auto you
- If you do have to fight, try to walk behind him as he W's to avoid the Brittle
- If he does waste his Q, W, or E, you can look for Q->PTA/Leg trades before he can W you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always look to stop him from building for free when you can by hitting him. Try to make him choose between building really far away and giving CS/EXP.
   - Some Ornn's will fake build in your face to bait you into Q->E range, or to waste your mana. 
   - Sometimes just standing close to Ornn without hitting/Qing is enough to stop his build
- Ornn's triple brittle combo with Ult legit can oneshot you from 80%HP if you're overextended. Do not disrespect Ornn's damage post-6
- You can buffer E into Ornn's Brittle auto knockback, but the timing is tricky. If you E too early he can knockdown your E with the auto
- If you have Brittle on you, if you're on top of Ornn's Q as it spawns, it will literally push you and consume the Brittle proc for damage


TIPS
- When Ornn summons his R, look to E or E + Flash before he gets it off, if they W they can't recast R2
- Ornn W will not deny your R2, it will execute after his W animation
- After level 9, Most Ornn's will use their E to run away. If you're fast enough, you can Q->E and grab him out of his E since it has an animation delay
- You hard outscale Ornn after 9/Black Cleaver as you can take extended trades now, and you outscale 1v1 for the rest of the game. He does bring equal teamfight value though, so if you can play sidelane it's better

   - REALLY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T OVERAGGRO LEVEL 1 AND LOSE FREE HP TO PANTH Q, ITS TOO HIGH RANGE/LOW CD TO OUTPLAY

HOW TO TRADE
- You can't really force trades if he has Q, it outranges you. Try to wiggle at his Q range, and if you dodge it look for a Q->PTA/Leg combo.
   - This lane just comes down to respecting his Q poke and range until you outscale.
- You can buffer E into his W, just be on the look out for it as it comes fast
   - Pre-9 however you don't want to E forwards unless hes ~60-70% HP, as he can kill you with Conq + Q + Ignite 
   - Post-9, if you E his W you insta kill him
- Just play slow and look to small trade with Q/Legs while dodging his Qs. If he wastes E, or he's <60%HP you can look to one shot with E + Flash + Ignite + R
- His E CAN Block your R2, and a lot of your E + Flash damage, but usually they will E the wrong way.
   - If they E towards you -> You E Flip them -> you can deal damage as they're E'ing the wrong way now
- If you look to Flip -> all-in with R, only press R once so you can wait for his E to expire

TIPS
- Pantheon is strong level 1-5, but falls off around level 6f as you get a combat ult and he doesn't.

- Look to get behind Poppy and fight level 1, but if she doesn't enter E range don't force it
- As the minions crash, they usually CS the first 3 with Q. Try to E -> PTA -> Disengage
- If she's not giving you E range, use your E for gapclose/shield -> Auto + Leg if she throws her buckler (Passive) auto at you

HOW TO TRADE
- Play slow in this lane, use your range + autos to do work, if she can hit you back with Q+ Passive it's losing
- When she has her buckler (Passive up), stay in bush/give CS until she consumes it. Earlier in the game you can E just to shield the damage -> Auto + Leg
- You can never E Poppy when she has her circle (W) up, but it does have a higher CD than your E
   - Against worse players, you can look to test their reactions on W level 1-3. Sometimes they won't press it, especially if you're a little closer to them
- BE TIGHT WITH YOUR SPACING. Poppy Q is about the same range as your auto, very slightly shorter 
   - When she walks up, Q->Leg/PTA trade, but be sure to use max range auto so she can't Q you
- If she's ~60% HP or wastes W, you can look for E + Flash + R kill. 
   - The best Poppys can W your E + Flash, so be respectful depending on your Elo
- If you can kill, lead with R -> They will channel R -> Buffer Poppy R with your E -> Kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Poppys will use their E on minions as a gapcloser/escape
   - Be careful of Poppy E'ing a minion -> right on top of you for Q -> you can't E because she has W
   - Also be careful of E + Flashing when she has a minion to E to for escape
- Always pay attention to how close you are to walls for her E, she does too much damage if she gets the stun off. 
   - The upper walls of top lane are closer than they seem
- Without flash up, you can't live a gank vs Poppy + Jungler as you can't E away and she can perma slow you

TIPS
- You can buffer Poppy E and R with your E. Both are tricky timings, especially the E
   - You need fast reactions for Poppy E bufer. Whenever you walk near a wall, just hover your E button. You will still get stunned, but you'll also Flip + Stun Poppy
   - Poppy R is a little easier, give some space so you can react
- YOU CAN FLIP (E) POPPY WITH HER CIRCLE (W) ON, IF YOU ARE ON TOP OF HER MODEL. 
   - If you are that close, it will insta flip, so it's not considered a dash, but you have to be RIGHT ON HER MODEL.
   - If she E+W,  you can buffer E into her E and W won't knock you down as you are close enough
- Recasting R2 will cancel knockbacks, so if Poppy has R'ed you while you R2 execute someone, it will put you back on the ground 
- Poppy always has relevancy due to her W, but you hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver'

- Level 1, try to get behind Quinn and E her. 
- They usually don't get in E range, so try to predict buffer E into her E. 
   - They usually Auto -> E, so try to time it after the first Auto
   - If you buffer successfully she literally just dies level 1
- If you can't, just try to take brush and match her push. Don't take too many free autos.

HOW TO TRADE
- Quinn is really weak to Urgot E as it puts her behind Urgot, so she can't E away like normal
- Stand behind minions to dodge her blind (Q) and Q poke until shes 75% HP, then look for E + Flash + R + Ignite oneshot
   - Only go for auto attacks if her Q/E is down
- Buffering E into Quinn E is always a guaranteed kill, but a really hard timing to get down as Quinn E comes out FAST.
   - They usually E after an empowered auto, so look to E around that timing
- If she's even slightly chunked (2-3 Qs), you can one shot at 6 with Ignite + Dirk/AD Components. Don't be afraid to just E + Flash
- It's important you don't waste your E, as she can take all your HP running you down with her MS + Passive autos

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q'ing against good Quinns, they can E OVER it and dodge it.
   - For some real mindgames, if they do this, you can buffer E as soon as you Q, that way if they E to dodge your Q you Flip them
- Her level 6 is really annoying for just roaming, make sure to spam your mid/jungle to be careful
- Keep her W vision reveal in mind when trying to cheese, I like to stand in the Alcove or really far back so she can't spot me

TIPS
- If you E + Flash Quinn, make sure to keep kiting towards her tower so she can't E to safety
- If you get a lead on Quinn, it's really hard for her to play 1v1, and you one shot her with E the entire game. She will just try to roam around the map, so make sure you punish if she does'

- Should always get level 2 prio, look to just slow push and get some deep vision

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is weird, you can only look to trade when his W isn't on. 
- If he has W on, only auto attack him if you have a leg up
- Look to trade and bait ous his W. Wait for his W to expire before dumping Q + PTA + W on him. 
   - If he takes enough damage with W down, you can kill with R
- Just use your range + autos whenever you can, try not to commit too much mana as he's hard to kill
- It's actually not that bad of a matchup because he has no kill pressure, just annoying. Just farm up and scale
- If you can flip him in front of tower with W on, you can kill him as he will get aggro

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- MAKE SURE YOU TURN W OFF BEFORE HE TAUNTS (E) YOU. You will insta die as each of your W ticks make you take full damage from his W + Thornmail
- His R is a pretty fast dash, so be patient with your R or wait for your E stun
- They usually look for the proxy, try to ward the river so you can see if he tries to. If you have an AP Jungler you can easily kill him.

TIPS
- Rammus is an easy lane, but even if he's 0-10 he will be UNKILLABLE if you don't have consistent AP damage (Azir good, Nidalee bad)
   - I would dodge if we were 3-4+ AD champs
- You never can really kill Rammus after he gets Thornmail, he just gets too much armor. Play to E/R him in teamfights where your AP champs can hit him'

HOW TO TRADE
- Use your range in this matchup, Q + PTA/Leg trade every time she tries to walk up for CS
- If you E first while Rek'Sai is burrowed, she can cancel it with burrowed W (knockup), so it's hard to E aggressively in this lane.
   - If she is unborrowed and below 70%, you can look to E. 
- If Rek'Sai tries to knock you up (W) first, you can buffer E and flip her. Be prepared for this if she tunnels (E) at you
- Realistically save E for E + Flash when she's around 50% HP.
   - She has to be lower than usual because she can time out your R with her R animation
- Her main tool is her SUSTAIN. Keep your spacing tight and don't enter her melee Q range, and you should always win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rek'Sai R can actually dodge your R2 if timed properly
- She can set up ganks really well with her tunnels, so respect jungle

TIPS
- This is a rather useless pick nowadays, it's weak in lane and gets MASSIVELY outscaled by Urgot in 1v1 and teamfights. 
- It's hard to force on Rek'Sai, so just play slow and grow a CS lead and outscale

- If he starts Q, you can just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA trade heavily. 
- Usually they start E, so Auto -> E backwards to try to predict his E through you. Even if you can't catch him with E, the free autos is still decent
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Renekton's has good short trades, good long trades (Conq + R), and high sustain (Q). He is a lane bully, so our primary goal should be to go even until 9/Black Cleaver
- Pay attention to his fury. If he has low fury, you can play aggressive with Q + PTA/Leg trades when he steps up. If he has high fury you have to respect
- Be tight with your spacing, try to get Q/Auto poke while avoiding his Q
- Buffering E into Renekton stun (W) is a good window to trade, they look to E->W (buffer E before they can E out)
   - HOWEVER, don't E forwards in the long lane if he's level 6 and now <60%HP, as his Ult + Conq can run you down
- Good Renketons will mix up his trading pattern, E-> Q -> E is hard to react to, just try to space his initial E
- Don't try to over trade in this lane, he has a lot of sustain, no mana, and stronger trades.

- If he doesn't facecheck, keep control of the brushes, and use your ward to keep vision as you go to CS
- Should get level 2 prio


HOW TO TRADE
- Rengar's W makes every trade winning for him before you have antiheal, game plan is to keep bushes warded and stand on the far side so he can't jump you
- AVOID FIGHTING NEAR BUSHES. Look to just play slow and scale up, if he gives you angles to poke take them and you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot if hes <60% HP.
   - Just make sure he has low ferocity stacks, as he can Empowered W your R2
- RUSH ANTIHEAL. Once you get antiheal you can take more aggressive trades, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade after he jumps to CS a minion. 
   - You can even try to predict E as he jumps

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rengar Empowered W can cleanse your Flip, stun, AND R2. Make sure to keep track of his ferocity when R/E'ing
- If you ward the brush and rengar sees it, he can insta oneshot it with Q. Make sure when you ward the brush he doesn't see it
- Spam ping when he goes MIA, his Ult is great at ganking your jungle/mid
- Leaping from brush at 0 ferocity gives him a stack, so be careful of his empowered cast in one spell rotation from brush

TIPS
- ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP THE BRUSH NEAREST YOUR TOWER WARDED. 
   - Then you don't have to be afraid of his bush cheese as the wave bounces back to him
- Rengar can't play when he's pushed in or frozen on, as he can't use the bushes to fight. 
- Keep the early game stable, that's his only window to cheese you. Once you're level 9, you hard statcheck Rengar, he can never jump you, and just keep him perma pushed in so he can't do anything

- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- SPACING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, always keep Riven at max range and use your Q + Autos + Legs to poke her down
   - If she Q's forwards, look for a Q -> PTA/Leg trade to deter her from coming closer with Q
   - Make her have to use E + Q1 to gapclose if she wants to trade, if she can Q early for damage it's hard
- This lane is based around her shield (E) CD. If it's up you have to respect and can't commit your E
- Look to Flip (E) on her stun (W) or Q3.
   - Q3 is riskier to E at, as it's higher range, and she can E away before your E connects, Don't recommend E'ing Riven's Q3 unless they're noobs
   - Better Rivens will look to E forwards -> W -> Auto -> Q out. Be prepared to flip during E->W, you will kill if you do this, but the timing is hard
- Repeat trades until shes 60-70%HP. If she wastes her E, you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R kill
- A good Riven will be hard to kill, so just focus on applying pressure with your auto + Q range. Build a CS lead and outscale.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL TO NOT LET HER BAIT YOUR E, IF YOU MISS E YOU DIE. 
- Riven is one of the best proxy champs, don't let her as she can easily kill your Jungler. Try to put vision in river and watch her if she tries to go around
- Do not underestimate Conq + Ignite + Level 6 Riven, she can kill you from 80%HP

TIPS
- This matchup is generally good for Urgot as he wins early + outscales, but Riven can definitely outplay at 6 with Ignite.  
   - If you fight anywhere not near your tower, be careful that she can just flash your E if you all-in (even from full HP)
- The longer the game goes the harder you outscale.  Hitting E on Riven in teamfights = instakill.
- CC absolutely fucks Riven, if you can pair Urgot with any CC jungler (Vi, Taliyah, etc) she cannot play'

- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- It's really hard to trade with Rumble after level 2-3, since his flamethrower (Q), W MS, and E slow let him space you easily. Give CS and preserve your HP.
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you. If he tries to Q you, stand your ground in your wave with Q + PTA/Legs. 
   - If you fight back, Rumble will click away meaning his Q won't be hitting you for a little
- Try your hardest to not fall behind. If you can't stand your ground in your wave, he can run behind your wave and Q->E you without consequences
- It's hard to play slow in this matchup, as he will just poke you down. Try to trade hard early game, then look to E + Flash + W + Ignite at level 2-3 for a kill
   - Even if you chunk + trade flashes, it's still fine
- If he ever wastes W, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade, or even an all-in if he's low enough
- At level 6, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill if hes ~70%HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he's near OVERHEAT, if you look to E + Flash and don't kill him in the Stun, his overheat autos HURT
- Dodge his E's, if he can hit both on you they shred a lot of MR and you get oneshot
- Rumble Q and E DO NOT DRAW MINION AGGRO, so don't feel too safe in a big wave.

TIPS
- It's quite hard to dodge Rumble E due to your large hitbox, standing behind minions is your best bet 
- If you Flip Rumble in Q, his Q will not face you, you can reduce some damage in the all-in this way
- If you fall behind/struggle, sitting on a Negatron Cloak isn't bad
- You outscale Rumble at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind, and demolish him as the game goes on in 1v1/teamfights. Going down 20CS in this lane is fine, just focus on getting EXP and not dying'

HOW TO TRADE
- Ryze outranges you and has strong poke, as well as strong disengage with W + Phase Rush
- Stand behind minions and look for Q poke. 
   - If he has no angle to bounce/hit Q on you, can extend Q->PTA/Leg trade

   - When you get near with Q slow + Approach Velocity MS, most Ryze's will try to root
   - BUFFER E THROUGH RYZE ROOT to hard win the trade. It's the same range as your E so if you E as soon as you're in range to flip, it will go thru usually
- Repeat until he's ~60%HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal
- Lane is tricky, especially because Ryze goes HP in Catalyst/ROA so he's hard to oneshot

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Respect his ability to kite you with Phase Rush, W slow, and range.
- Be careful of standing too close to minions, Ryze can E->Q chain off the minions to hit you

EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Sejuani and fight level 1. If she starts her Flail (W) just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- If she starts Q, she can knockdown your E. Look to trade Autos 
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Play around her W, it's her main damage ability. If she uses it, kite side to side to dodge it
   - When it's on cooldown look for Q->PTA/Leg trade
- You can Buffer her Dash (Q) with E, they usually don't Q in but be ready to Flip if she does
- Be ready to buffer E away from her R or stun (E). She has really low kill threat in lane but sets up ganks extremely well
- Maintain your spacing, and play to punish her on every CS with Q/Autos. As long as you don't eat too many Ws, she can't do much and you outscale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E at her first, she can knock it down with Q.
- Her burst damage with R + Ignite + her full combo does a lot of damage, don't disrespect if you're ~60%HP

TIPS
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game 1v1. She has good utility in teamfights, but yours is better. Try to play sidelane as you are much stronger there

- His R cancels your E, be careful 

- You hard outscale Sett after 9, he gets one tapped before he can W in teamfights usually

2025-05-04 23:11:08,027 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E149: Details='EARLY GAME
- Be careful in fighting Sett level 1, he's strong with W + Conq. 
- As the minions crash, auto him once. If you see his Grit stack, disengage (he has W) and just play for push, small chip autos.
- If it doesn't, he has E and you can look to Auto -> Flip -> Auto Auto PTA. 
   - Try to buffer E through his E
- You should always get level 2 prio as long as you don't give him a big W charge

HOW TO TRADE
- Don't let him stack W. Look for small Q + PTA trades, then insta disengage before he can E->W you.
   - If he Ws, you will have enough range to dodge the center by moving side to side
- Sett has long CDs, but it's hard to make him use them unfavorably. Just farming and outscaling in this matchup is good
   - Of course if he does waste his W, you can look to take a big trade. 
- Never E forwards aggressively until 9/Black Cleaver unless he's chunked. He has really good extended trades with Conq + W
- If he tries to Q for MS -> E you to force trades, be ready to buffer E away. If you can do this, he can't ever force trades on you. 
- If hes ~40-50% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R one shot before he can W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He has really high sustain when he gets low, if you don't have Ignite, don't overforce trying to kill him without E unless you have R to execute
- Sett R cancels your E completely, so be careful E'ing around him.
- Also be careful when E'ing forwards in lane, as he can ult you back into his tower/side of the map to extend the trade

TIPS
- You can actually flip Sett as he W's behind you, so that his W completely misses. However this is risky as the timing has to be clean, and if he combos E->W it could mess it up
- You are stronger at 9/Black Cleaver, but nothing too crazy. As the game goes on you destroy him, especially if you can bait out/dodge the W, he has nothing
- In teamfights just make sure you don't give Sett an angle to R you into your backline
   - If you E->R Sett in fights with followup, often you can 1shot him so fast they can't even press W

- Can look to fight Level 1, but spacing is important. Shen's Q hurts early game if he can melee ran ge you
- Look to just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA as he tries to CS the first 3 creeps
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is all about spacing and playing your range + autos. Shen should never be able to walk up and Q + Grasp auto you
   - His Q does give him 50 more AA range
- You can buffer E into his taunt (E). Early game if they are aggro they might taunt you, be ready to buffer E 
   - If he's close to you, buffer E backwards.
   - If he's farther away, you can buffer E at him
- Don't lead with E in trades, as he can W or E away himself.
- If you flip him, hold W for after his W. They usually will drop their zone (W) immediately
- Shen's laning power is really low. It's important you focus on wave management. 
   - You always want to SLOW PUSH, to be able to crash a big wave and deny Shen EXP/CS if he Ults away at 6
      - You can also freeze, but pushing is way better
- SPAM PING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF SHEN ULT WHEN HE HITS 6, THE ONLY THING SHEN CAN DO IS MAKE YOUR TEAM LOSE (Which is pretty big)

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Shen's Q does more damage if he drags it through your body (it also slows you if you are running away)
- Shen can nullify you in teamfights quite hard with his Ult + W + Taunt to deny your E and R

TIPS
- I like Demolish in this matchup as you can take a plate or 2 every time he Ults away
- Once you hit 9, if Shen just sits under his tower, look to proxy waves and create tempo on the map so he can't R away easily
- Bone Plating is decent over Overgrowth if you struggle in this lane, denies his Taunt (E) trade hard'

- WALK WITH YOUR WAVE LEVEL 1. DO NOT LET SINGED PROXY!
- If Singed starts in lane, just walk at him and fight him ASAP. He's so weak level 1, you cook him if you hit E
   - Be careful if Singed Qs the wave, if you miss E/get kited, he can hit level 2 fast

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is super easy. You outrange and bully Singed, ouscale him, and can even deny his Flip (E) with your own E buffer
- Watch out for 3 things:
   1) Singed E + Flash into his W ground under his tower
        - If you are careful with your autos/read his body language for when he wants to Flash, this is easily outplayable
   2) Singed getting to Proxy
        - NEVER GRIEF YOUR TEMPO, WARD THE RIVER/WRAP AROUND ENTRANCES, AND KEEP PUSHING HIM IN OR FREEZING
        - Conciously think about how Singed could potentially proxy you and look to stop it. 
        - Singed can only play the game if he can proxy, so you want to deny him the proxy AT ALL COSTS
   3) Jungle ganks
        - He has really good gank setup, so try to get deep vision out before you push Singed in
- If you don't blunder those 3 things, Singed can literally not play. Use your Range and punish/deny him off every CS With Q + PTA/Leg trades
- You can buffer his E by E'ing backwards.Uno Reverse you flip him instead
- You can buffer E while his W goo is midair, so he can't ground you from Eing

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Read the above section
- Conq Ignite Singed can be quite scary at level 6. 

TIPS
- Singed will usually have to give up EXP/CS and roam a lot in this matchup. Give your mid/bot lots of MIA pings
- If Singed is in the proxy position, it's worth giving a wave to push him out if your jungle is on your side. If you can't, look to proxy yourself if you're level 9
- You hard outscale Singed, but he provides lots of utility in teamfights even if really behind. Look to sidelane a lot, he can't really stop you from just taking the towers'

- Level 1 look to fight, just look for Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage trade
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Like most tank lanes, this matchup is not bad until Sion gets his first armor item on base (esp Steelcaps or Wardens mail)
- Sion can space and take small trades vs Urgot really easily with his E/Q knockup/W shield
   - It's hard for Urgot to outplay. We just look to not interact and outscale
- If he wastes Q or W, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade
- Unless Sion is chunked or really behind, don't E forwards unless near your tower. He's so tanky you're never killing, and he can win the extended trade with his 2nd Q rotation
- The only interaction is trying to buffer Sion Q with E, but it's really hard as Sion can release Q at any point
   - This buffer interaction takes a lot of experience to know when to "time" your E
   - You can try to time it on the max charged Sion Q (it's always the same time), but that's risky since it will do a lot of damage + Stun you for a longer time. Generally not worth to go for
   - The closer you are to Sion the easier it is to buffer E, max range Es into his Q are much easier for him to knockdown. 
- Approach Velocity is clutch in this matchup as you can gapclose Q->E fast enough before he can charge his Q enough

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Pay attention to your minions, Sion will try to E them thru you to slow so he can trade with his Q
- Sion R can immune your R2. Generally no way around this since his ult lasts way longer than yours does, you can't just time it out

TIPS
- Try to break his shield (W) before he can activate it, then it does no damage
- You can buffer E into sion R
- You hard outscale Sion with your %HP Legs and Ult. Just make sure you don't fall behind in lane and in teamfights, he's really easy to E->R '

HOW TO TRADE

- Maintain your spacing, don't let him Grasp auto you for free. He has no trading tools if you stand behind minions to avoid his boulder toss (Q)
- You can look to E if he enters your range, he's not that strong.
- The only thing you have to be careful for is getting R/E kidnapped into tower when your wave is near his tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Skarner R completely cancels your E, do not E if he looks to Ult
- You can E his E if you time it right before it connects
- He has insane gank setup, so care for jungle

TIPS
- Not really sure how this lane plays out (haven't seen it in a year), but it's been pretty nerfed and I can't imagine too bad
- You definitely hard outscale Skarner, so just focus on CS/farm like all tank matchups.

   - If not, just auto + leg and get level 2 prio
- If he takes a chunk level 1, E + Flash + W + Ignite insta kills him at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really easy matchup, the only thing Sylas can do is max Q and farm from range
- If he ever E2's you, just buffer E into it and he gets 1shot with Ignite
- Don't E if he has E up. Just use your range, Q + Auto + PTA + Legs demolish Sylas, he's really squishy
- Sometimes Sylas will gapclose with W (it's a short dash), if you're ready you can snag them with E on this. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If he is putting points in Q, make sure you are dodging them. The delayed Q explosion does more damage, so don't get hit by that
- Be careful if he can take good ults like Swain or Alistar in teamfights

TIPS
- Sylas damage is front loaded, and he's pretty squishy if you have Ignite. Don't be afraid of continuing the fight if he gets a good initial trade
- You beat Sylas at all points during the game 1v1, and he has a hard time coming back into the game. Be aggressive and fight hard, just don't die to jungle

HOW TO TRADE
- Stand behind minions so he can't Q you and TK can't interact with you. 
- Maintain your spacing! If he can't stack his passive on you with free Autos, you get to free scale
- If he goes for CS, look for Q->PTA/Leg trades as long as you can stand behind a minion to not get hit by his Q
- If TK jumps at you (W), BUFFER YOUR E AT HIS SHADOW ON THE GROUND. You can look to Auto, then dodge side to side for his Q as he becomes unstunned
- Post level 9, you can take extended trades with him hard, just make sure you don't get kidnapped under tower
- Watch his grey health -> shield when looking to all-in with R. 
   - Try to save your E for when hes ~40% so that even if he shields after, he'll be under the 25% R Execute range still


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- TK's only real kill angle is to Q->R kidnap you under tower.
   - If TK does land Q on you, be very careful. The slow will let him auto you -> Eat (R) you.
- Always be careful under his tower so he doesn't kidnap you. It's not worth harassing him under tower, just crash the wave and back up unless he's low.

TIPS
- You demolish TK 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game in the 1v1. 
- TK is generally useless in teamfights compared to you unless giga fed. If you can E->R him with followup, he will usually die before he can shield or W away

- As the minions crash, take the bush. When he autos, E for shield -> Auto -> Disengage

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke teemo out with Q until hes ~70% HP, then you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot
- If Teemo uses/wastes his blind (Q), you can look to take a heavier Q->PTA trade
   - If he has blind (Q) up, don't look to over trade
- If Teemo moves to close to you, you can look to Q->E if he's under 60-70% HP. Be careful Flipping if he's full HP, since his blind + Ignite can win an all-in before 6
- Teemo will always die if you hit Flip (E), but he's very fast with a small hitbox. Be patient, slowly Q poke him down, then E + Flash, or look to Q->E->R
   - If he wastes his blind (Q) for random poke don't be afraid to E flash all in
- Your Q is really important, use it to space/push Teemo back if he tries to trade. If you miss it Teemo can look to sprint at you and AA you down. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E + Flash + R all-in when Teemo has blind (Q) up, make sure you know your lethal limits, since he can time half your ult out with Q
- Try to keep a ward in the bush closest to your tower, so you can see if he goes invisible there to cheese after the wave crashes into your tower

TIPS
- If you ever E him and he blinds you before he gets stunned, hold your W until you are unblinded
- Teemo has high auto range, so TAKE THE BUSH. 
- Rushing merc treads is strong, the extra movement speed helps with combing Q->E and tenacity reduces the blind duration
- Swap to Red trinket at 9 to clear shrooms
- Annoying champ in lane, but falls off hard. You are much stronger in sidelane/teamfights if not behind!

   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies

TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well

2025-05-04 23:11:08,036 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E176: Details='EARLY GAME
- Don't fight Tryndamere until minions arrive
- Always start in lane: Don't let Trynda get free fury stacks
- Instantly look to take bush/auto him as he walks up. Don't let him stack fury for free
   - Hold your E, just use your autos. If he spins on you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - If he doesn't spin, push him off CS with your legs/range and get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- You can play really aggressive in this matchup with PTA + Ignite pre-6, but after 6 you have to play a lot more respectful. 
-  His R/sustain counter you from lvl 6-9 just let the wave push into you and farm. They usually hit it a lot to stack fury
- If the wave is pushing out, slow push and build big waves. Stand in front of your minions and try to auto, so he can't stack fury, and hope the wave crashes
- Trade based around his fury:
   - If he has low fury, look to be aggressive and use your Range + Legs to push him off so he can't auto for fury
   - If he has high fury, you have to respect AND HOLD YOUR Q. If he spins on you, use your Q to slow and make space. You don't want to E here or he can run you down/dive you
- Never E forwards if he has ult, high fury, or full HP. Also keep in mind he can E to dodge your E
- HOW TO PLAY THE ALL-IN/DIVE:
   - We want to use the FULL 4s of our R slow + R pull animation to time out his ult
   - Make sure you R him at ~200HP. If R base damage can "kill" Trynda (even if he's in R) it will AUTO PULL. THAT IS BAD.
   - As he dives,  once he's lower: R -> E/Auto to force his R -> Run and let R2 auto time out after 4s -> Pull him in + Ignite -> Hope his R is over
       - Usually Tryndamere will have ~0.5-1s of Ult left, so hit him with an auto and Ignite 
       - MAKE SURE YOU IGNITE AT THE END OF THE FIGHT SO ITS NOT WASTED IN HIS R


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, they will always look to run you down with W slow + Ghost + Lethal Tempo
- Tryndamere has INFINITE SUSTAIN and is hard to all-in because of R. Don't overtrade/OOM yourself with Q/E, just use your Range + Autos
- Tryndamere W is "castable" without needing vision of you. He can tell if you're cheesing in a bush

TIPS
- Try to get Plated Steelcaps first base
- After 9/Black Cleaver you hard outscale for the rest of the game
   - You hard outscale Tryndamere because later on, you do so much damage you force his R in your E flip alone
   - Then you can kite him out easily. You won't kill, but Tryndamere without R IS NOT A CHAMP.'

- If he doesn't facecheck you, it's hard to E due to TF's range. Look to E to gapclose -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- He's really squishy, so if you can trade level 1 he gets oneshot at level 2 with E + F + Ignite + W
- Hard to get prio due to his range, take the bushes and try to match his push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke TF out with Q+Leg Autos until we can E + Flash + R + Ignite at 70%HP
- If he has his card up (W), don't auto, just Q. If he's used it then you can go for a Q -> PTA trade
- Always try to take control of the bush so he can't auto you for free
- Early game his range and damage are quite oppressive, you don't need to force trades. 
    - Level 6 this matchup gets much easier because of your R
- You can buffer E through his gold card, but it still outranges so you won't Flip
   - UNLESS you have a lot of MS, then you can Q->E, but make sure to get really close after Qing and buffer E just as the gold card hits


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-  His damage comes from his E proc, pay attention to when it's up
- Be careful of the Red Card splash damage around minions
- TF has INSANE ROAMS/GANKS with Ghost, his Ult, and Gold card. Really make sure to ping your team so they respect his ganking power

TIPS
- TF is a very summ (ghost/flash) reliant champ, look to punish when they are down (esp if you have Flash up)
- No one really plays AD TF top anymore, but his scaling is still strong if he doesn't fall behind. As long as you hit E + Flash he insta dies though

- As minions arrive, look to Auto Udyr but don't E. He usually will just drop empowered R, back off when he does so. 
- Hard to get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- This is an annoying lane, Udyr's R lets him waveclear + trade simultaneously, and his W give him infinite sustain
- Can't really interact, just let him push you in and farm up. You hard outscale
- Pay attention to his Awakened Bar, you can only kill if he's low and not near Awakened W
- Keep your range and don't let him walk up and auto you for free
- Save Phase Rush for when he tries to E stun -> Empowered R you
- It's honestly not worth the mana to Q for damage, you can't really kill until 9/Black Cleaver and he has SO MUCH SUSTAIN

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His empowered E is TRUE CC IMMUNITY, Meaning it denies your R2 pull (and your E)
- His empowered W gives him a lot of health + big shield, be careful to not get baited

TIPS
- The lane is low interaction and boring, but you hard outscale Udyr, especially around level 13. He's mainly a shield/CC bot in teamfights'

- Set him up for a lvl 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill
- Take bush and try your best to match his push, his range gives him level 2 prio usually

HOW TO TRADE
- Really difficult matchup, Varus's base damage is so high he kind of stat checks you at all points
- If he has Bone Plating, PTA, Barrier it's really difficult as he can fight you early with this setup. Try to get behind him and if you can hit E with Ignite you can still win.
- If he has no barrier, you can 1-shot him with E flash at all points.
- Just look for Q poke when you can and avoid getting into his Auto range
- Rush Dirk for the dirk level 6 Ignite powerspike, so you can oneshot from 80/90% HP.
- If  he messes up spacing and you can gapclose with Q->E, look for that. If he doesn't, really important you don't waste Flash as you need it to one shot. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-If you can't manage to get leads on him early, it's really important you respect his level up timers/range. He deals a ton of damage from a long range, and if you take one bad trade it's hard to overcome that HP difference in an all-in. 

TIPS
- You can buffer your E away if he tries to R you
- You don't outscale Varus, but you can always one shot him if you go damage build. Try to establish a kill or take his flash early so he's vulnerable to ganks/E flash, and if you can't just play conservatively until a window opens up.

- DO NOT PUSH IN THIS MATCHUP EARLY, LET HER PUSH YOU IN.  You cannot crash the wave if you try to push

HOW TO TRADE
- Goal is to poke her to 75% with Q, then look for E + Flash + R oneshot
- When Vayne Qs forward, look to trade with Q+PTA
- If you Q first, Vayne can tumble over your Q and take a good trade
- Save your E + Flash for AFTER she tumbles, or she can dodge it
- If you ever hit E, vayne dies, but you can usually only hit with Flash. If you have enough MS, you can Q->E if she tumbles forward. 
- Do not even try to kill her/trade if your Flash is down, just preserve HP and farm

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- YOU CANNOT KILL VAYNE WITHOUT FLASH. You cannot make a mistake in this lane, and you cannot waste Flash
- Really good Vayne's can buffer condemn (E) into your E + Flash. Don't worry about this too much

TIPS
- Edge of Night first is very good into Vayne, as she can only pop it with her E and if her E is on cd you can run her down
- Vayne scales very hard and has no room for mistakes, even from behind she will be trouble. It just comes down to whether you can land the E on her or not.

- Look to disengage after he backs off before his Q comes up again if he's not in lethal range to ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Wincons in this lane:
    - Constant pressure on Vlad with Q -> leg + auto, especially when his Q is on CD (you can see it's CD from his resource bar), to not let him slowly outsustain you with his healing
    - Not letting him empowered Q you
    - Killing with E flash before he can pool
- If you let Vlad play the slow game and push you in/slowly chip at your HP with Q you will be pushed out of lane and outscaled
- Early on try to test how good his reactions are by Eing at him.
    - Pretend you are disengaging and walk backwards after a Q auto trade, he will walk forwards as you walk back, then E him
    - Against competent Vladimirs though, you will only ever be able to E him before he pools with E + Flash (if the Vladimir is good enough to pool this its gg for you)
- At 70%, look for E + Flash + Ignite + R.
    - Even if he is able to cast pool after your E stun wears off, Ignite will tick him down and you can execute when he resurfaces from W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful not to R2 during his pool animation, as it can block R2

TIPS
- Vladimir likes to run straight at you when he gets his empowered Q ms, this is an easy timing to Q poke him 
- If you haven't found leads early game, just focus on farming until 9. At 9 you have the DPS to E to gapclose and stick on Vlad with Q slow

HOW TO TRADE
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in Autos/Legs without letting him Q
- Your autos barely outrange his Q, so spacing is very important as if he trade autos/Q you lose out eventually
- USE YOUR RANGE, PUSH HIM IN, POKE HIM, BUT DO NOT LET HIM Q YOU! You have to space
- If he walks up to CS, Q->PTA/Leg combo 
- You can use your E to small trade, try to flip him sideways rather than behind you.
   - Make space after you Flip so he can't Q easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he does choose to fight you, trading perma without having lethal is good for Warwick - being half HP or below is Warwick's win con
    - Even if it looks like it's going well at the start Warwick wins lane by being unkillable below 25% HP and then just outsustains you
- DON'T GET BAITED. Warwick wants to be low so he gets more damage + healing, and all his healing/tankiness is backloaded with his R/E
    - Also factor in his BARRIER + E
- Be careful of Warwick getting movement speed in lane early due to your team being low on the map

TIPS

- Do not prolong the fight, he wins with max Passive + Conq stacks

HOW TO TRADE
- The wincon for Urgot in this matchup is being tanky/healthy enough to hold E until after Wukong W clones during his all ins level 6-8
- Very important to not waste E or panic E if he engages on you, as he can just W clone to dodge it. 
- You need to be very patient and hold your E, Wukong usually has W for dmg: R -> W after knockup ends -> R to have enough damage to kill you
    - If you still have your E up you can threaten E flash ignite R one shot even if you're much lower
    - If you're confident, you can immediately E into his E. If you're fast with it, you can catch him in the E animation before he clones. This is generally risky though so best done later in the game/under your tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Wukong's Q range scales with Q level, and is about the same as your auto range at 9. His main poking pattern in lane is E minion -> Q so watch for this to not get poked down

TIPS
- Ignite early in fights so you cut his conq/passive healing immediately and don't risk igniting his clone
- You can always tell if you E Wukong or his clone, Eing the clone will have a weird "stop" animation and it wont be a fluid E. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN USE R IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FLIP OR NOT

HOW TO TRADE
- Yasuo is a hard matchup as he has infinite dashes to dodge your E, Windwall blocks Q R1 and R2, and shield to win short trades as well while also winning long trades pre-9
- Winning this matchup comes down to being patient with your E, if you hit E you win.

    - If you waste your E and he dodges it by dashing through minions you will get run down and die
- Look for E + Flash + R one shot when he's at 60%. 
    - He has to be a little lower than other champs because his windwall will instantly cut off all your damage once he gets unstunned.
- Just let him push you in and farm until you're 9, they usually hit the wave to stack Q


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His windwall will also block your R2 recast, so don't spam R2 unless you can execute him while he's stunned. Try to walk around it so it's not in between you and Yasuo if you can
- Buffering E into his Q3 -> R is really hard. If he tornados you, don't bother buffering E, save it until after his R

2025-05-04 23:11:08,046 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   D206: Summary='- Wincon is trading aound his W. Try to bait it out, then look to Q->PTA trade if he misses

- Never E when he has E1 up. His E2 immunes your flip (he'll still be stunned tho)

- Buffer E into his Q3, but care if its a max range Q3 as that outranges your E

- Buffer E backwards if he R's you

- You outscale at 9+, and generally outscale him the whole game if you're ahead
'

- Level 1 you can look to fight Yone, try to sidestep his Q before looking to E. 
- If he doesn't give E range, sidestep Q -> Leg + Auto is also good
- Should get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades are based around Yone W. Try to bait it out, then look for Q->PTA trades
- Never E Yone if he has E up. You want to buffer E when he Q3's forward
   - Be careful as Yone max range Q3 gives him enough space to click back and dodge Urgot E
- If Yone E > Q3s, just E to force his E snapback, or else he can take a beefy trade. 
   - In general, you never really have windows to E yone unless his E is on CD
- Look to E + Flash + R Yone at 70% HP. 
   - If he has E up to dodge your E FLash,  to make it less obvious, Q/Auto trade -> pretend to run away -> E + Flash when he rechases
- Urgot can buffer Yone R by E'ing BACKWARDS

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Until 9, Yone generally has stronger short trades with W, and long trades with lethal tempo. You can't force trades on him
   - Focusing on farming/going even until then is smart
- Be careful on wasting your E, it's really easy for Yone to re-engage with Q3/E and run you down

TIPS
- You smoke Yone after 9/Black Cleaver. I like going a lethality build after that since Yone is a hard scaling tank shredder, he gets one tapped

- His W cage can cancel your E

- Dodge side to side to avoid his E

- You have more use in teamfights, 1v1 is hard until 2/3 items'

- You can look to fight Yorick hard early game, if he respects and starts E just play for level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- EXTREMELY LOW INTERACTION MATCHUP, Yorick just pushes you in post 6 with his infinite ghoul army
    - Sit under tower and farm
- This matchup comes down to sidestepping his E, it's his only ranged tool
    - The hitbox of it grows larger if you try to dodge backwards, but its quite narrow on the sides, so dodge it by side stepping side to side
    - When it's on cooldown you can Q->PTA trade as his ghouls won't auto target you
    - Play at his E max range so if it hits you, you have time to E away before he can cage you
- If he W cages you, your W won't target the cage unless there is absolutely nothing else to hit
    - Don't W and manually auto the cage to get out
- Post 6 it's heavily Yorick favored once he has his maiden, but can look to fight if it dies
- Fortunately Yorick auto pushes the lane with his maidens/ghouls so you can just scale for free
- If he somehow is <60% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Yorick Cage can knockdown and cancel your E.
- You no longer one shot his ghouls
- His Q heals for %missing HP, don't get baited thinking he's low, especially if you have no antiheal

TIPS
- Cull is a strong buy for some sustain in this lane since there's 0 kill potential
- He falls off after lane and you have more value in teamfights. The 1v1 is always difficult if he has maiden though

- Stand behind minions to avoid his Q, use your range + autos to trade. Never let him walk up and auto + W you for free'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,047 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E212: Details='EARLY GAME
- Zac is weak early game, can fight him level 1, especially if he starts W
- If he starts Q try to dodge it, or wait until he slams you to E -> Auto
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Zac's Q cancels Urgot E at every point (casting or buffering), so you have to stand behind minions/dodge it. If he hits it he can full combo you Q->E->W
- Zac has infinite sustain, so we must use our range to trade
    - Q + PTA if he walks up for CS
    - Don't take mindless trades where he can W/auto, he will out sustain you easily. 
- If he E jumps you look to buffer your E on the shadow, then sidestep the followup Q he will throw at you in a straight line
- If played properly, this is mainly a farming lane. Slow push big waves and try to build a CS lead. Zac is quite hard to kill if he doesn't want to die and they almost always will play passive to scale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited into flashing on him early game, his revive blobs are really hard to kill in time if you've used your E/W already
- Make sure you can insta kill if you flash before he Ults, the knockup and heal buy a lot of time

TIPS
- STEP ON THE BLOBS! 
- Rush executioners, Zac's entire 1v1 capability is based around his absurd healing, level 6+ do not try to all in unless you have antiheal
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver/Executioners, and for the rest of the game

- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,464 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E5: Details='EARLY GAME
- Get behind Aatrox and look to fight level 1.
    - Try to bait out the Q1 by spacing max range
    - Walk closer and Auto + E in his Q2 animation (Need to be inner edge of Q2)
    - If you FLIP, click away from Q3 and trade autos/PTA

HOW TO TRADE:
- It's all about spacing and playing around his Q. 
- Goal is to trade with Q/Autos/PTA when his Q is on CD. Repeat until hes ~70%, and you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill.

- You cannot flip Aatrox in Q1 + E, it's too long. Look to FLIP on his Q2 + E
    - Aatrox Q1 + Es forward, sidestep side to side 
    - Q2, click away, then click towards him to try to get him to Q2 + E FORWARDS. This is where you try to FLIP him.
    - Make space so he can't Q3 you after FLIPPING

- This lane is really hard if you can't find leads pre-6/first base, as he can slowly poke you down at range with Q1 + E forever. 
- Only look to E if his E is on cooldown


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Q1 damage is hard to avoid, but does minimal damage. Getting hit by Q2 is a lot more damage, so be careful with spacing/buffering E into Q2
- Good Aatrox's will mix up E'ing forwards on Q2, be careful not to get baited. 
- Hard lane as you have to be very knowledgable if your E hits or not. If you miss E/fail E buffer into his Q, you will take too much damage
- Once Aatrox gets Plated Steelcaps, the MS + armor make it extremely hard to trade back
   - Try to fight hard first 3 levels, if he's not behind and TPs back with Steelcaps it's cooked
- Ignite (or anti-heal) is mandatory if you try to kill him. Have to know lethal limits well in this matchup, as he can heal with Passive + Q above 25% if you try to E flash him

TIPS
- You can "ride" Aatrox W pull by buffering E. Useful in catching them off guard if they're prepping W -> Q under your tower for instance
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver'

- Don't E if she has her E up. During all-ins be patient with E W/E and R

2025-05-04 23:11:08,466 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E8: Details='EARLY GAME
- Akali is weak level 1, get behind her and fight
   - If she skills Q, FLIP on her empowered auto. If she skills E, she will not Q as you walk up, so just use your ranged autos to trade and hold E

HOW TO TRADE
- Once Akali gets her W and E, this matchup gets hard as you can't FLIP until she's used both W and E
- Wiggle around her max Q range, if she misses Q, you can look for small Q/leg/PTA trades. 
   - Repeat until she's ~70% HP and you can look for Flash + E + R + Ignite lethal before she can shroud or E away
      - Ignite can tick her down for 25% ult lethal when she's in shroud
- If she hits Q, use your Q slow to space her - you can't trade back if she drops shroud, and taking poke in this lane is bad
- Only look to play small trades around her Q cd/energy levels (if she doesnt get empowered auto off she can only Q twice) until she's in oneshot range. Respect until then and outscale
- Her W and E have long CDs, so if she wastes them look to trade aggressively

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Post 6, Akali can one shot you from ~80% HP, especially if you're pushed up. 
   - You can't reliably E until she's used her E, W, and R, so it's very hard to live. Really focus on not taking bad trades and be respectful (esp if she has Ignite)
- Never E at her directly if she has E up, she can dodge it with her E easily

TIPS
- Buying MR or HP early (negatron/phage) over AD early is better, as you need to be able to tank her abilities before you can E. AD is not as good early on unless as you can't hit her while she's shrouded
- You can buffer your E into her E2 
- Outscale at 9, and hard outscale for the rest of the game. 
   - You get too tanky to oneshot, and you can just leave W on and chunk her everytime she exits shroud to Q/Auto'

- You can look to fight Akshan level 1, but he has to face check you in bush/walk into E range. 
   - If he respects the cheese, don't overforce it. His range and Q slow can kite you out level 1, and he can trade autos with you early.
- He's very strong early, so just focus on farming/Q poke if he doesn't mess up. Your kill windows are at 6 with Ult + Ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Look to Q+Leg/PTA trade after Akshan uses his Q, the slow from it is what sets up his trading patterns. Without it, he's vulnerable
   - Remember to not stand behind minions as it extends his Q range
   - If he hits Q, run away and try to space him with your Q slow to deny his followup Autos. 
- Repeat until you can set up lethal. He's very squishy so you can E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal at 6 from ~80% HP. 
- Hard to E Akshan without Flash, he has high range + E to disengage. Don't force trades and play around his Q CD

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He hits HARD, so be careful about letting him get the Q + double hit passive + PTA trades on you.  
- His invisiblity makes good roams, so make sure to MIA ping when he's gone.
- Akshan is a very snowbally champ, take care to not die early and fall behind. If he has strong item bases, his trades are unplayable, but if he doesn't get a lead he dies whenever your Flash is up

TIPS
- Go Dirk/AD items first base if you have Ignite + Flash up at level 6. If you're flash is down, build Plated Steelcaps. 
- His E can be body blocked to knock him down, try to stand in his E path if you get on top of him.'

- She has really high CDs, if she wastes her abilities (especially her W shield) or gets too close, look to trade

- Really try to fight her level 1, as once she gets level 3+ it's hard to ever hit E.
- Get behind her in the bush and try to PREDICT her Q dash when you E. Getting a good trade in level 1 makes this lane a lot more playable
   - Even if you miss E, you can still win the trade with E shield + PTA/legs 

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is difficult with Ambessa because you can't reliably E until she's used all her abilities. Mainly just try to sustain/minimize trading, she has high sustain and no mana costs so she can poke you out hard.
- Ambessa dictates the trades due to her mobility, play around short Q + W/PTA trades when she's in your range
- When she Q1 dashes in -> Q2 dashes out, stand in your wave.
   - Her Q2 does reduced damage if it hits a minion first, and will push the wave back to you as well
   - You can also look to predict E if she gets in range if you are near your tower. Even if you miss, the shield will help the trade
- She has really high CDs, so if she wastes her abilities (especially her shield W), or dashes too close into your E range, look to trade. If she doesn't mess up though, you don't really have windows to fight back unfortunately.
- Really hard to kill Ambessa pre-9. After 9, you can look to take extended trades while she's in between CDs.
- Don't be afraid to E + Flash to kill, really hard to land E on her normally.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Ambessa R will CANCEL your E, never try to buffer E into her R
- Her shielding, passive omnivamp, doran's shield + grasp, and no mana costs makes her a really insane laner. You have to be very careful with your HP/Mana, if you fall behind this lane gets omega hard.

TIPS
- Ambessa's damage is all up front in burst/shielding, and then she has long CDs. If she's still in range, look to fight, especially post-9. 
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind. You do outscale Ambessa if you can hit E, but she scales very very well too.'

- Aurora is not weak early game due to her passive, but you can still fight her. 
- Get behind her and try to push her into the river. She has high range, so if she doesn't int, just use E to gapclose/shield Auto -> E -> Auto -> Auto (PTA), then disengage.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is based around Aurora Q CD. If she has Q up, you have to respect, as it sets up her passive/electrocute trades too well.
   - Try to bait out her Q at max range, then you can look for a Q + PTA/Legs trade.
   - If she has Q up, only look to Q for trading, don't Auto
- Repeat until shes at ~70% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal.
- I like to take Ignite in this lane as playing small, slow trades usually favors Aurora. You have to all-in, and Ignite + early AD items lets you E + Flash at much higher HP levels. 
   - Ignite also helps as if she has a second to R away, Ignite can still tick her down and get you the kill
- Really important in this lane to not let her get free passive procs off, as it gives her sustain. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- When you E + Flash Aurora, make sure you can kill in the E stun. She has a lot of tools to escape/time out your ultimate.
- Aurora E is actually a buffer, good Auroras can buffer your E with her E. Be a little careful of immediately ulting after E + Flash if they can do this.
- Make sure you don't waste Flash, you have no kill potential without Flash and she can just bully you under tower for 5 minutes.
- She can actually dodge your R2 with her R teleport, but it's really hard to time. Not something you have to really play around.

TIPS
- Keep track of her dashes (W and E), as they have long CDs. If she wastes them you can look to take really aggressive trades. '

- Get behind him and just try to trade as much as possible. E to gapclose/shield if you can't get in range, this will help you get prio for level 2, then look for E +Flash with Ignite.

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is very difficult because Azir bullies you in lane, outranges you, outscales you, and is also hard to gank.
- You cannot play this lane slowly, Azir will always win.  You have to make it volatile and play for a fast E + Flash + Ignite + R oneshot before he pokes you down too much
- Try your best to avoid his Soldier + Q poke trades, and look to Q poke whenever you can. You will usually take more damage, but you can one shot him from much higher HP.
   - If you can find pockets that his soldiers aren't in, you can look to Q + PTA trade. 
- You NEED Flash to kill Azir. Without Flash he will just bully you for 5 minutes under tower, his range is too high for a normal E. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- You have to give CS in this matchup to preserve HP. If you have no way to reset, be very careful tanking his Soldier + Q combo, as if you get too low you can't threaten all in even with summs up.
- You need your jungler to gank you in this matchup, but it's hard to gank Azir as he has his dash + ult to disengage. 
- Be careful of E'ing in too close to his tower, as he can R you into tower aggro

TIPS
- You can buffer your E into his R, the interaction is a little buggy. If your E connects with Azir as he R's you, you will not be pushed and can flip Azir

- Look to get behind Camille and trade level 1. As soon as the wave meets in the middle, look for an Auto -> E. 
   - If you time the E right, you will flip her before she gets her passive up
   - Don't immediately auto again, look to create space so you can get 1-2 more autos for PTA proc in before she can auto you for her Passive shield

HOW TO TRADE
- Camille's W is the main ability to play around, as she cannot get her passive/Qs on you without the slow. 
  - Whenever her W is on CD, we can trade
   - Q her and run at her -> prepare to click backwards to dodge the W -> once her W is gone, look for PTA/Leg trade
      - The slow from Q and MS from Approach Velocity makes it really easy to bait out Camille W this way
- You can buffer E into camille E, so they can't just force E trades on you.
   - Be careful when Camille's are hovering walls, if they're right next to a wall their E can come out surprisingly fast, making it hard to react E to.
- You cannot let her hit W -> Q1/Q2 with Passive shield combo, you will lose too much HP and then she can threaten lethal. 
- If her passive is down and she is not near a wall, you can look to E and trade hard

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Camille's main strength is her gank setup, MAKE SURE TO TRACK ENEMY JUNGLE and not overextend if you don't have vision. 
- Camille R can dodge your E and your R, so usually you need to buffer your E into her E, or E + Flash her to guarantee your E -> R landing.
   - Camille can buffer her her own E -> R, so if she knows you can E her E, be careful of this interaction
- Camille E (hookshot) can buffer your E if it hasn't "attached" to the wall when she's flipped. If you Flip her AFTER it attaches, it will fizzle and she will die. 
- You CANNOT fall behind Camille in lane, or you can never play as she can engage on you from 2 screens out perma

TIPS
- You outscale Camille at 9/Black Cleaver. Generally you win 1v1 vs her all game, but you have to hit E. 
- Your ignite and R go through her passive shield. You can tick her below lethal with Ignite even if she gets the shield.'

- Even if you can't kill her, chunking her is still really good as it sets her up for lethal at level 2 with Ignite + Flash + E

HOW TO TRADE
- Can't play slow trades in this lane, as her Q will eventually poke you out. Play aggressive with your Flash up.
- Even and slightly losing trades are still ok as you can threaten lethal as long as she isn't full HP
- Dodge her Q, then look for Q->PTA small trades to poke her down. If she has Q up, you can Q, but do not go for Autos.
   - If she hits Q, wait out the poison
   - Repeat until she's ~80% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite lethal. 
- Q -> click forwards -> click backwards to try to bait our her Q, they get scared when slowed and you run at them
- Cassio is really squishy at 6 with Ignite, you can oneshot her from really high HP. Just be careful that you don't take too much poke damage. 
- After 6, with enough MS, you can Q -> Run at her -> Buffer E through her R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Do not fight if she lands Q on you
- Be careful of being stunned when near bushes, she can Ult -> W combo you
- Her extended trade is really strong with E spam + Conq, you can't Flip her from full HP, she has to be chunked a little before or she ramps too hard
- Cassio buys a lot of HP (ROA), and even armor sometimes. The matchup gets hard if she hasn't fallen behind and she buys Catalyst first back, as she has too much HP to oneshot now

TIPS
- You can buffer E through her grounding (W) and R, use this to not get caught out. If she can W you, the slow + inability to E will take too much of your HP
- With W on, you can dodge Cassio R by clicking BEHIND YOU. 
   - Visually you'll still face her, but YOU WON'T GET STUNNED
   - Cassio's R stun logic goes off of where your last click was (towards or away from Cass) not your visual model

- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Don't fight level 1 until the minons arrive and crash
- Some Darius's will start W and try to cheese YOU by getting behind you. If he runs from behind you, stand your ground in your wave and Flip him to disengage
- Usually they'll start Q, and try to Q the first 3 creeps, look to space it and get a chunk in. You should always get level 2 Prio as you are ranged.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades in this matchup are based around Darius Q. 
   - Bait it out by wiggling at max range, when it's on CD look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades to chunk him
- Goal is to chunk him to 70%HP before looking for an extended all in. With Ignite and at that HP, he can't get to 5 stacks in time. If you fight 100% to 100% HP, he will have time to 5 stack you and win.
   - But we can only look for these chunks when his Q is on CD
   - Try to freeze lane as much as possible, so we can poke without getting run down
   - When it pushes out, try to slow push. A big minon wave helps if he tries to all in you in the long lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, especially early game, as Darius wants to run you down
- If you miss E, you die
   - Watch out for being in positions where if Darius can just flash your E and then run you down
- If he ever gets a free Q/starts with stacks, don't fight
- Do not Flip forwards aggressively unless Darius is ~70%HP. If he survives at low HP (which he will if >70%HP), he can E->Q with 5 stacks for a gigaheal

TIPS
- You have kill potential on Darius at every stage of the game, but it's Darius favored pre-6. You hard win at 9/Black Cleaver.
- You can buffer his pull (E) with your E, but it's a hard timing to pull off. Try to predict when he'll E you.
   - If you buffer his E you guaranteed win, as he can't get to the outside Q edge.
- In this matchup, missing E is death. Don't hesitate to E flash, as he can easily dodge with flash/ghost. 
- Don't be afraid! You have to stand your ground in this matchup, if you E away defensively you will lose. '

- If you chunk him enough, you can easily E + Flash + Ignite one shot at level 2.
   - Usually Mundo's run Ghost TP, so if they don't have Flash it's guaranteed.

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a neutral scaling matchup, it's not that bad for Urgot as long as you stand behind minions to avoid Mundo's Q/E damage
   - You can't really stop his farming with Q, and he can't really stop your farming if you stand behind minions
- You should never be able to E Mundo as he can outrange with Q, so you can't even take his passive
- Everytime Mundo walks up for CS or misses Q, look for a small Q + PTA/Legs trade to chunk him. 
   - Do the same when he's at his tower CS'ing, just poke him down.
   - He has really low health regen in lane, so damage actually sticks to him
- When Mundo is at ~60/70%, to kill:
   - Lead off with R -> E + Flash with the R slow. The E pops off the passive, then you can circle around and execute with R2.
   

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Mundo passive denies your E AND your R2 pull. 
- Your E does not lock-on your W if he has his passive

TIPS
- You outscale at level 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game if not behind. 
   - Most Mundos stack HP and not armor, so your legs + R %HP damage hit HARD in the 1v1 and in teamfights
- If you have Ignite/anti-heal, Mundo's R at rank 1 barely heals. You can execute him with R easily still.
- His passive has a really long CD early, be sure to step on it if you pop it off

- Try to kite the parry/vitals, if she misses Q (or doesn't get the vital MS) this is your window to trade back
- Level 6+, use R to bait out the parry
   - E is more important to land, especially because parrying E will stun you as well.
- Pre-9, it's 50/50, but you have kill potential if you play it well. At level 9 until 2-3 items, you hard win as she eats every leg trying to proc vitals

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful when Q'ing when she wants to Q a vital, she can Q over your Q and then it's hard to trade
- She can parry your E and both casts of your R
- Be mindful of your vitals, if she gets too many free ones with Q + Grasp, you'll be too low to all-in. Important to not fall behind in this lane due to her scaling

TIPS
- Anti-heal is necessary if you don't have Ignite. Bramble is better early for lane, but executioner's scales harder.
- You can reset bad vitals by walking out of range of Fiora
- Position near walls during her R so you can block a vital by hugging a wall.
- After you E + Flash, unless she's super low, don't spam R2 as Fiora's will spam parry as soon as they're unstunned, and may parry your R2 this way
- Fiora outscales you at 3+ items, she just does way too much damage. Important to establish leads before then.
- You can Ctrl + 3 fake Ult emote to try to bait out her parry (best on pj/butcher skins) (https://x.com/quantelol/status/1729204401838158066/video/1)'

- Level 1, definitely look to fight GP:
    - GP's will usually start Barrel (E), and have one prepped in the bush.
    -  If you manage to sneak into the bush and he doesn't see you as minions crash, look for auto + E on GP, then KILL THE BARREL while he's stunned. You can also look to auto the barrel at the start 
    - If he respects the cheese, try to wiggle around the 2nd barrel's chain range to bait it out.  You can E + leg auto to gapclose/shield through the barrel explosion
    - You should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is based around his Barrels (E) and his Q. Always wiggle at 2nd barrel chain range to see if you can bait it out.
   - If he wastes/misses his barrels, look to Flip him, or if not in range for E, a Q + PTA/leg trade is good. 
       - He has an indicator below his HP bar of how many barrels he has left
   - Respect his Q range, especially once he has SHEEN. 
       - Early game his Q only hurts with Grasp up, but after Sheen it is REALLY IMPORTANT you don't let him just perma Q you. 
       - Farm/space with your Q, hide in bushes, don't let him Q you on cooldown. 
       - If he Q's you, try to Q + PTA trade back if there are no barrels around
- GP is really weak without his barrels, if you can pop, dodge, or walk around his barrel radius, you can take heavy trades. 
   - Try to always space far enough out to make him use at least 2 barrels
- When GP is ~60% HP (or if he wastes his Oranges), you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R all in. The ignite is nice as it really cuts his Orange healing. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- HIS ORANGE CAN CLEANSE YOUR R2 EXECUTE. You need to force him to Orange (W) thru damage, before your Ult times out and auto pulls. 
   - This requires high knowledge of your damage. Be sure that if you all-in GP, he's not too high HP and you hold your ultimate for a little so it doesn't time out. 
   - Only press R once! This way it won't auto cast and he can just Orange (W) out. 
- Good GP's will look to Orange (W) your E stun when you E + Flash. Be patient with your R after you E + Flash, because if they orange the E stun they won't be behind you like normal


TIPS
- It's a hard matchup (esp vs Dshield/Grasp GP) until 9 vs good GP, he can just space you perma. After 9/Black Cleaver, and especially at level 13/2 items, you hard beat GP if you hit E. He outscales in teamfights at full build though
- Really really important you don't fall behind after GP gets SHEEN until 9. It's really braindead point and click no counterplay spell, you have to respect and not take too much damage
- At level 9, with no minions around, the matchup gets a lot easier as it's really easy to pop his barrels with W'

- If Garen Q's at you, keep your space and use Q to push him back. Try not to overuse mana

- If they have Conq/Ignite, RESPECT HARD at 6

- You outscale turbo after 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,479 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E44: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to fight Garen really hard early game. If they start E, Auto -> E -> Space their E -> PTA
- If they start W, it's impossible to deal meaningful damage, just look for a PTA proc then drop minion aggro in brush.
- You have complete wave control in this matchup until the wave crashes and bounces back, around level 3

HOW TO TRADE
- If Garen has W up, E'ing into him will always be negative, as even if you win the short trade he will outsustain your HP/mana eventually
- I play this lane by lane-locking garen with my Teleport (with reduced CD from Cosmic Insight), and stacking large item leads on him
    - I don't like to play to fistfight/trade with Garen, as he has infinite resources
    - If we trade hard early game, I'll use my first TP for a Cull buy, else I usually want Phage (1100g) or Pickaxe + Long Sword (1225g)
- Keep your spacing TIGHT. Always keep him at range. If he runs at you with Q, Q him to make space and autos
    - Use your range and autoattacks (no mana cost) in this matchup as much as possible
    - Again, if you try to trade by E'ing at Garen with W, you will just lose out in the long run due to mana costs/lack of sustain
    -  You can look to E the Garen as he Q's at you if he's not as good, sometimes they won't W. Depends on the elo.
- Your Q is only worth the mana to stop his passive from ticking, or to setup a PTA + leg trade. Q alone is not worth the mana for it's damage here
- After flipping Garen, make sure to space a little bit to get out of his E range before following up with Autos
- Always look to stop Garen's passive from ticking, especially if he's lower HP


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Garen cleanses slows with his Q, so make sure you Q him AFTER he Q's when trading
- Keep track of his Phase Rush, it gives slow resists too so if it's active, careful with your R as he'll just run away.
- Garen's love to proxy, especially if they fall behind. Try to keep vision in the river/think to yourself "can he go proxy here?" and stop him from doing so. 
- At 9, make sure you don't turn your W off when he Q (silences you). 
   

TIPS
- You hard outscale Garen at 9/Black Cleaver, you just stat check Garen and lose little DPS when silenced.
- If he has Conqueror + Ignite, you have to be very very respectful level 6+. Taking one trade will put you in lethal range.
   - Conq Garen is USELESS after you hit level 9, and is very weak in teamfights.
   - Phase Rush Garen needs Ignite to kill in lane, but generally has much weaker kill pressure, but scales much harder and can play sidelane later on vs Urgot.

'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,481 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E47: Details='EARLY GAME
- Really important to fight Gnar level 1 after minions crash. Walk behind him, if he starts Q: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA is 70% of his HP, and sets up a really easy E + Flash + Ignite kill
- If they're good, they'll skill jump (E). BE READY FOR THIS AND HOVER YOUR MOUSE BEHIND YOU to prepare for him double jumping off you
   - If you're fast enough you'll still flip him mid-jump
- If you can Flip/chunk Gnar level 1, it makes your game way easier to play
- Even if you can't Flip him, you hard win by just Eing forwards + legs + PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup doesn't start out too bad, but gets progressively worse as Gnar gets more items. Plated Steelcaps, Phage, Q slow + W MS makes it really hard to touch Mini Gnar, and Mega Gnar does too much damage
   - You really want to force his TP before he gets gold for Plated Steelcaps (1200g) as the lane is UNPLAYABLE afterwards, that's why the level 1 chunk is important
- Play around his Q. If it's up you have to respect his range, but if he uses/misses it, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade.
   - Good movement in this lane to dodge Q, especially Mega Gnar Q, is SUPER important. Hitting one Q -> W passive proc lets him chain run you down for a huge chunk
- When he's in Mega Gnar, you have to be very respectful. Just let it time out and look to re-aggro when he's Mini
   - You CAN Buffer E into his Mega Gnar W/R, which is helpful, but he's so over-statted in Mega you can still lose so be careful
- At 60-70%, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot, just know your damage levels as he can double hop (E) out if you don't kill in the stun.
- When you E or E + Flash Gnar, always click to the side so he can't double hop (E) out after the stun expires


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you haven't gotten a lead by the time gnar gets Plated Steelcaps and/or Phage, just play passively and scale. 
   - It's unrealistic to force trades on Gnar with these items
- Be careful of fighting when he's close to Mega Gnar, he gets a lot of HP/resistances
- Be respectful of his double hop (E) on a minion -> transform -> Mega Gnar R -> W combo, it has super high range and can easily kill/chunk you

TIPS
- Gnar scales pretty well, at 9/Black Cleaver is when the matchup becomes even again, but it's not favored. Gnar's scaling is pretty even to Urgot's, it just depends if you can hit E on him while in Mini Gnar if you win or not
- If he's low rage at the start of teamfights, look to focus him before he can transform.

- Look to get behind Gragas level 1 and fight. Gragas usually starts Body Slam (E), so make sure you are READY to buffer E into his E, you can take 70% of his HP if you do
- Should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Buffering your E into Gragas E is the main way you trade in this lane. Always have your E prepared, as you hard win if you successfully buffer it
- If Gragas doesn't E, you don't really have many options. He will stand back and throw barrels (Q) while healing from his passive, it's very low interaction
   - Good movement to dodge his Q is very important, try not to stand on minions so he has to choose between farming or poking
- It's hard for Gragas to walk up melee range to CS, you can Q + Auto/Leg if he does. They will usually farm with barrels
   - If they use/miss their barrel (Q), look to run at Gragas and take a Q + PTA trade. Again, prepare yourself to potentially buffer his E if he slams at you here
- Repeat until he's ~60-70% HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal. 
   - Make sure you know your damage as his R + E can let him escape really easily if not one shot

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Buffering Gragas E is tricky if he's right on top of you. Try to leave some space in between so you have more time to react.
- A lot of Gragas's will look to knock you into tower with R, but you can buffer Gragas R with E
   - Save your E to try to bait out his ult, it's really easy to outplay
- Gragas W auto is AOE, be careful to not stand too close to his target minion for the splash damage

TIPS
- Gragas is annoying in lane due to his Q + passive healing playstyle, but it's not the worst and you hard outscale him in the 1v1, and in teamfights too. Focus on not taking too much poke and farming up
- Cull to match his sustain is really nice in this lane'

- It's a little hard to get prio for level 2 because Graves AOE autos, but try to match his autos. If you chunked him level 1, you can one shot with E + Flash + Ignite at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Graves's game plan is to spam push the wave in, and slowly chip you down with auto/Q poke. He has very low 1v1/trading power
- Look to Q + PTA/Leg trade whenever you can. His Q has a long snapback time, so you can fight even if his Q is up, but definitely look to trade if he Q's the wave
- Only look to E him if his dash (E) has been used. He has no reason to use it as he outranges your E with autos, so it's hard to force it out.
   - Also remember that his E stacks give him armor
- Repeat until hes at ~70% HP, then you can kill with E + Flash + Ignite + R, depending on his grit (armor from E) stacks

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his Q bounce angles, especially under tower. That's his main source of poke damage
- If you E + Flash, smokescreen + E + R are effective escape tools, so make sure you have lethal in the stun


TIPS
- Early Dirk/AD items in this lane feel really nice with Ignite. It's hard to play slow poke into graves (he has fleet + lifesteal usually for sustain), so just threatening the all-in E + Flash immediately is effective
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game, especially with Flash up

- Level 1 walk behind her and fight. If they skill Q, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage is a great trade.

HOW TO TRADE
- Look for Q -> PTA/Leg trades when she has 0-1 Q stacks, or if her Q or E are on CD. Don't let her stack Q on minions for free, always look to sneak in Auto/Qs.
- If she has 3-4 stacks, you have to be careful, dodge side to side so Gwen Q->E won't clip you in the center
   - You can look to predict E when she Q->E's forward ONLY if she's below 70%HP. If she's full HP, she'll win the extended trade with a 2nd Q rotation + Conq
- Never E Gwen if she has E up, she can dodge it easily
   - Make sure if you do E, you hit it. Don't be afraid to E + Flash, if you miss E you die
- If Gwen wastes E and she's below 70%HP, you can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all-in.
   - If she has E up, they can react to E + Flash if they're good and it's riskier
- If Gwen wastes W she's also extremely vulnerable and you can look for trades

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Gwen's Shroud (W) makes this matchup quite hard. Gwen can Q->E with Shroud (W) up so you can't hit back, be careful that you don't click into her melee range trying to click on her
- If you E Gwen from outside the shroud, you'll still Flip. HOWEVER:
   - SUPER SECRET MECHANIC: If Gwen stands on the PIXEL EDGE of her Shroud (W), your E will go through her and die. This mechanic makes the matchup SUPER HARD vs Gwen's that know this.
- Her shroud can block your R2 if you go outside of it

TIPS
- A lot of Gwen's damage is backloaded (Q4, R3), and Urgot's R execute + Ignite is a good way of dealing with that if she's chunked out enough at the start
- Gwen's usually don't take Flash, and the champion is really vulnerable to ganks. Calling your jungler if you have E + Flash up is a good way to kill Gwen
- Gwen is pretty strong in lane nowdays, and scales well. If you snowball you destroy her but she will always be useful if she can get to 3+ items

- Heimer is not a matchup you can fuck with level 1 as his turrets are very strong.
- You can only fight if you have Ignite and he facechecks you, which is unlikely. Just let him push you in

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really low interaction matchup that you can't really look for trades in. Heimer just pushes you in perma, and you get to scale up.
- You can look for small Q poke, but going for Autos is risky as if he grenades (E) you, you lose way too much HP.
- When he grenades (E) you, buffer your E away so you don't tank the charged beam from the towers. 
- Stand behind minions to avoid the rocket (W) poke.
- If Heimer gets low enough or wastes his E, you can one shot with E + Flash + R, but its hard as if he doesn't die within the E stun, you will always die. You can still die even if you kill him as his towers will still hit

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Although it's very unfun, you should be careful of calling your jungler to gank Heimerdinger unless it's obviously free. He has easy 2v1 potential if either of you misplay the gank.
- You can't hit his towers without them hitting you back, your range is too short. 
- He gets lots of MS around his towers, so be careful when Q'ing or E + Flashing
- Be careful of facechecking bushes, he can oneshot you from full HP with some AP

TIPS
- Heimer is a champ that requires lots of kills in lane to be useful later. If you can just farm evenly (or even slightly behind), you'll be 2x his usefulness in teamfights later
- Early negatron/mercs rush is not bad.  You can also play Ignite if you're a Chad and try to kill.

- Definitely want to try to fight Illaoi hard level 1, and pre-6 in general. She becomes impossible to kill post-6 with her R
- Get behind her and look to fight. Try to fight outside of tentacle range, Illaoi W start + tentacles nearby can actually trade with Urgot level 1
- You should get prio. If you don't manage to fight until minions arrive, respect her Q range, or if she isn't Qing be ready to E her W if she W's at you 

HOW TO TRADE
- Illaoi E is the main ability you have to play around. If it's up, especially post-6, you cannot go aggro
   - You can look to trade as hard as you want if she misses it, this is your main window
   - If she hits it, try to exit the tether range ASAP to avoid damage. 
- Always stand behind minions, and try to Q + PTA/Leg trade when she CSes. 
   - You have to be respectful of her Q as well though, have good spacing and don't let her slap you for free
- Illaoi loves to try to hump you under tower, fishing for Es/Qs. This is the only window where you can look to kill Illaoi with E + Flash + R, as she self stuns with her ability animations, and it's easy for her to get tower aggro
- You can kill pre-6 with Ignite, but after 6 it's entirely Illaoi favored

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Illaoi's ult makes her displacement immune, meaning if well timed she can immune your E flip. If the Illaoi is good, you'll almost always have to look for a E + Flash to kill
- Illaois like to Q/W + tentacle the wave to insta kill your minions, opening you up for a surprise E. Be careful for this
- The tentacles still slap, even if you kill them
- Be careful of calling your jungler to gank Illaoi unless its for sure free, she can easily 2v1.
   - Both of you have to dodge the E if you want to gank

TIPS

- Illaoi is a champ that can only lane, unless you have 5 melee champs. She's useless in teamfights so going even and scaling up is a win for Urgot

- Hard matchup after level 3, you cannot make a mistake in this lane or she will perma freeze

- Be patient with your E, she will try to bait it out by Qing away

- Buffer E backwards if she Qs you to flip

- Try to just farm, and make sure you crash your wave

- Look hard to fight Irelia level 1. If you can E her before the minions get low and she can't Q away, you smoke her
- If Irelia doesn't appear until the minions are low, be careful of her dodging your E by QQQ'ing the first 3 minions -> Q you with full passive
   - In this scenario, try to predict your E into her Q on the minions
- If Irelia starts E, try to zone her off the first 3 EXP. If she walks up you fist her

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is determined on how many stacks she has/she can get: 
   - When the wave is pushing into you, show respect pre-9, she has max stacks 
   - When the wave is pushing into her, you have to be careful. Try to walk AHEAD of your wave and fight her so she can't dash around thru your wave
   - MAKE SURE YOUR WAVE CRASHES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK IRELIAS FREEZE 1v1
- If she E->Q's you, E behind yourself, not at her, or it will miss
- HOLD YOUR E UNTIL GUARANTEED. They will always try to bait it out with Q dash. 
- If she wastes W, you can look to play aggressive, they usually use it to setup the minion wave to Q through, so be careful  you don't miss E
- You have to stand your ground and fight with Ignite in this matchup, if she can fight you in your minion wave and win you can't play the game


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very patient with your E, always pay attention if she's trying to bait it with a minion to Q to. 
- Her W gives her damage reduction, so don't ult too early if she negates your E damage with W
- She powerspikes hard on BORK and Plated Steelcaps
- If she gets a freeze on you pre-9, hopefully your jungler comes to help, but if not look to roam or put pressure on the map. YOU CAN'T BREAK IT SOLO

TIPS
- This is a very difficult matchup vs good Irelias, and if you make one mistake they can freeze on you forever. 
   - Really focus on playing aggro first 3 waves, and then respecting afterwards if she doesn't fuck up
- You turbo outscale Irelia, especially in teamfights, as long as you get your EXP you're fine.
- Can rush bramble vest + plated steelcaps yourself if you fall behind, your base damage at 9 can stat check her hard

- You can fight him level 1, just save your E to buffer his E.  
- If you take the brush, Auto -> E -> Space out his E while he's stunned -> Auto Auto PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane pre-9 you always want to play for the freeze. Jax wants the long lane to run you down with max passive stacks
    - Never fight when the wave is pushing into you
    - Jax has a hard time breaking freezes and will eat a lot of damage while being vulnerable to ganks.
    - Very important to look to poke Jax while wave is frozen so when it bounces out you can kill him before he ramps his stacks up
- Very E cooldown-based matchup, whoever E's first loses. Always Buffer your E into his E
    - If you E his E, always click away to not get stunned before Autoing again
- Your Q is also super important, when he jumps on you -> Q under yourself to make space -> Land E
   - Jax's model places him "in" you, so if you E forwards immediately it won't connect
   - Also be careful that he can jump over your Q and then trade
- If he jumps on you with E, buffer it with your E -> Q -> PTA trade and you win. 
   - You can also just E if you can make a tiny bit of space between you guys, usually you have to E backwards/to the side.
- If he jumps on you without using E, Q -> PTA trade, and hold your E
- You can look to all in from 70% HP if you buffer his E, Ignite + R kills him easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Jax's will know you want to Buffer E into his counterstrike (E), and will try to sidestep in their E animation
- When Jax has passive + grasp stacks up, you have to respect. 
- Keep in mind Jax's minions when he walks up with E. They'll try to bait your E, then Q to their minion out of range
- Spacing is super important in this lane, don't let him W + Grasp trade with you for free. 
   - You need an HP advantage pre-9 to trade, or else he can just all in you before you can kill. 
- If he manages to stun you while you flip him, be careful in buffering your R, as he can jump away to dodge it once you're both unstunned

TIPS
- You have kill potential at every point during this lane as long as you're not in the long lane.
- Ignite really helps in this lane as it goes thru his counterstrike (E) 
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver for the rest of the game

- Look to fight Jayce level 1, if you manage to Flip him it makes the lane significantly easier
- Most Jayce's start E or Q, try to push them into the brush and ignite early for vision. 
- If you can Flip/chunk Jayce, level 2 prio -> E + Flash is an easy solokill

HOW TO TRADE
- When facing Jayce:
   - Stay behind minions to dodge his ranged Q
   - Use the brush/respect his auto range to not let him get free autos off
- Just look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades if he enters your range. Use your Q slow to push him off if he's trying to auto you a lot
- If he fucks up his spacing you can even look to Q -> E combo, but be careful of doing this if he's full HP, or you don't have Ult/Ignite. Jayce does a lot of damage if you can't finish him off instantly
- You usually will never have the range to normal E Jayce. Only if he melee Qs into you can you look to E
- Jayce MS gate (ranged E) and knockback (melee E) give him insane self-peel, it's really easy for him to kite you. Missing E/Q can lead to a really bad trade
- With Ignite and early AD items, you one shot Jayce from ~75%HP with E + Flash. Can give CS to avoid taking poke until he's in kill range
   - Because of Jayce's oppressive poke, it's important to look to one-shot before he can slowly poke you down
- When he transforms from Melee -> Ranged, this is a good window to look to all-in as he can't melee E (knockback) for a couple seconds
- You can buffer E into Jayce E, but you have to predict it as it roots you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Jayce's main poke tool is his QE from range, try to walk in random directions when you don't have a minion wave to cover you (like when you're CS'ing under tower)
- Jayce will often look to melee Q your minions, and hit you with the AOE damage. Be respectful of the melee Q radius if you stand too close to your wave
- Jayce has built in mana refund, and sustain with Dblade/biscuits, so his resources are deceptively high

TIPS
- Jayce is a really annoying lane bully, and the better the Jayce the more annoying. I've tried many setups into Jayce like Plated Steepcaps rush + play passive, but I think the best strategy is GIGA AGGRO level 1, and build Dirk/Pickaxe/Long Swords and try to just E + Flash + Ignite instantly. 
   - Cheesing Jayce early is so important, as he has 6 abilities at level 3 and you can no longer trade favorably
   - Playing slow is also just hard vs good Jayces, they can space your Q/E too easily and he has such insane poke
- Playing for level 6 spike (you get an ult, he doesn't) is a good strategy
- You beat Jayce at 9/Black Cleaver and outscale 1v1 and in teamfights the rest of the game'

EARLY GAME
- If Kalista facechecks you in a brush early, you can fight, but generally respect and give her range. Her hop is too OP at kiting level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- It's pretty impossible to trade with Kalista, if she doesn't walk into your E range early game focus on giving cs and PRESERVING HP
- If you can predict Q into her hop, look for a small Q + PTA leg trade
   - This chunk can set her up to be killed at level 2/3 with E + Flash + Ignite
- If she's full HP, just focus on not taking too much poke and hitting Q/Legs when you can, don't overforce trades.
- If you haven't found a lead early game, rush Dirk/AD Items and try to one shot at 6 from ~80%HP with E + Flash + R + Ignite
- Kalista usually perma pushes and is very vulnerable to ganks. If you can't find leads 1v1, just make sure you save Flash for jungle ganks
- Never E at her in front of her, only E + Flash. She's too high range to ever hit a normal E 
    - Very important to not lose Flash as you need it to exist in the lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Care for her Q poke + E resetting on minions to chain slow/auto you poke
- Pay attention to her "hop rythm", if she keeps dashing in one direction look to predict poke with Q where she hops

TIPS
- It's a hard lane, but a very uncommon pick. Only really insane Kalista players can pilot Kalista well enough to make it work.
   - It has to get a lot of kills in lane to be useful later on
   - Kalista top also griefs the enemy draft hard usually
- Kalista gets crippled by CC, so playing around your jungler and trying to make it to teamfights is a very viable strategy

HOW TO TRADE

   - Just stand behind your minions to avoid Q damage
- If she wastes her empowered R ability, or her shield, you can look for a small Q + PTA trade to chunk her. 
- Generally, I don't look to interact much in this matchup. Conserve HP, play for a Dirk/Pickaxe first base
   - Then at 6, I look to E + Flash + Ignite + R  oneshot after she uses R+Q to poke
   - You have to wait for her to use R, if she has R + W it heals too much and can prevent your ult from executing
- Once you get some levels and MS going, you can Q- > E combo her. If you hit Flip you hard win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited by her HP if she has R + W up, it heals a lot.
- Her R + Q has extended range, so be careful not to get caught at the max range

2025-05-04 23:11:08,489 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E80: Details='EARLY GAME
- It is critical you fight Kayle level 1. Get behind her, Flip her, and try to zone her off the first 3 creeps of EXP
- If you chunked her enough level 1, you can look for a dive on the 2nd/3rd wave as you crash into tower.
   - If not, play to setup a freeze/gank angle as the wave then bounces back into you. 
      - Kayle is so weak at this point in the game that you can just walk behind the wave and zone her/fight her 1v1, denying her even more EXP

HOW TO TRADE
- Denying Kayle pre-6 is really important for how trades play out in this lane post-6
- Always look to Q -> E pre-6 Kayle, but focus on not hitting the wave too much. 
   - You want the wave to be pushing into you so you can deny/zone off EXP and setup ganks, which is more important than the trades
   - If you deny enough EXP, you can freeze the wave when you're 6 to her 5, which is huge
- Once Kayle hits 6, it's much harder to hit Q. Still look for Q + PTA/leg trades if you can, but they're rare, especially if she rushes T2 boots
- You can still E + Flash on Kayle post-6 if you have Ignite + AD items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kayle R can block your R2 pull, and in general they will R as you E + Flash to deny burst
   - If you E + Flash, try to see if she insta ults before immediately W'ing + R. If she does, hold off a bit on your burst until it times out.
- Watch out for Kayle's Q thru the minions, and E poke. The damage from these add up
- T2 boots + max passive stacks (gives MS) + W MS make her extremely fast in lane, don't disrespect and miss your E

TIPS
- If you can't find leads in this lane pre-6, don't overforce until level 9. It feels bad, but Kayle will bully you until you get 9/Black Cleaver, so just focus on going even until that spike again
- Kayle outscales you again around 3 items/level 16, so try to close it out early. Her R is a very powerful tool to deny your R

- If he respects your cheese, you can try to trade autos + Legs + PTA by just E'ing forwards to gapclose
- Should get prio for level 2 if played right

HOW TO TRADE
- The main ability to watch out for is his shuriken (Q). Stand behind minions to dodge it, and look for Q + PTA/Leg trades if he gets in range
   - Only look to Q -> Auto if you can't get hit by his Q. If you can, only Q to poke
   - Generally it's hard to look for Q as his Q outranges yours
- Repeat until he's 65%HP, then you can look to E + Flash + R one shot
   - He has really insane escape tools with his W MS and Stun, so make sure you have lethal on the Flip or he will escape fast 
- RUSH MERC TREADS. With merc treads, if he's slowed by Q, you can Q -> E combo usually even if he gets W speed and still Flip. The tenacity helps a lot too, as it lets you buffer E before you get stunned. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his passive stacks on you (3 = stun), if he can Q -> W -> Stun, he can Q you again as you are stunned, which is too much HP to lose
- His empowered auto + W combo hurts, give CS/respect until he uses the empowered auto to CS
- Kennen is a really OP teamfighter. Try to always mark him, or ward flanks/keep track of his flash, Kennen R + Flash can insta win teamfights

- You can fight Kled early in a small trade, but don't extend. You don't have the damage to kill level 1, and he will get too much free courage if dismounted
- Fight as the minion wave arrives. Look to sidestep his Q and trade Autos
   - If he hits Q, E TO THE SIDE FOR THE SHIELD, and auto with legs/PTA. It's risky to flip forwards INTO HIM level 1, as he can trade autos with you, dismount with Conq stacks, and then get a lot of courage to remount before you can kill.

HOW TO TRADE
- The key to this matchup is not dismounting Kled until your E is up
   - If you start off the trade with E, don't dismount him. Don't auto attack him, just walk away to buy time for your E CD
   - If he's able to start the fight at like 30-40% courage he can almost always remount before you can kill, especially if he has his W up.
   - Once Kled is dismounted, E + Flash + W + Ignite is a guaranteed kill
- When you trade, it's important you don't dismount him without the ability to kill, or else the next fight he will remount and gain way too much HP to ever fight again
- Look to sidestep his Q, then go for Q -> PTA/Leg trades. 
   - Try to also tether at max Q range, that way even if he hits it you can walk away from it before it yoinks you (the yoink does way more damage)
- If he wastes W on a minion, you can look to trade 
- Only look to Flip Mounted Kled in this matchup if he's chunked ~60% HP, that way you can kill with R + Ignite before he remounts
- Try to R him right before he dismounts, as he gets a smaller hitbox + Q dash and is harder to hit with R
- Your E can "ride" Kled Q for a guaranteed flip (as long as he doesn't E away). 
   - This is useful when Kled looks to mounted Q you while in his dismount animation, you can ride the Q with your E -> R -> kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kled has one of the strongest level 3's in the game, be respectful of his E -> Q -> W combo
- A lot of Kled's will not level their W until they need it to remount, don't get baited
- Be careful when you E + Flash + R when he's almost dismounted, he goes invulnerable as he dismounts, so your R can miss
- Dismounted Kled's Q is actually a buffer, good Kled's can try to counterplay your E with this
- If you R Kled as he remounts, his remount invcan deny your R2
- Kled R gives him really strong roams/ganks on mid lane, make sure to ping his location


TIPS
- Your E can buffer his R for a guaranteed flip
- Kled needs kills in lane to be useful, you OMEGA outscale Kled as the game goes on.
- Kled players rely on knowing when to remount better than you do to get kills. Don't play into this, only dismount when you have E -> R combo up for guaranteed execute'

- You can never really go aggressive in this lane, just trying to outscale and be more useful in teamfights
- As he goes for CS, look for small Q + Leg poke. Be respectful of his Q range, and his E -> Q range as well. If Q's a minion, you can look for longer trades
- You can buffer your E into his Q3 knockup
   - Be careful with this, as they can W or E to counter your E buffer if they know about it
- Once he gets his first armor item (Chain Vest) HE IS OMEGA HITLER. He can dash (E) at you in your own wave and still win the trade. 
   - Preemptively click down to dodge his E->Q combo
- You can never E at him if he has W or E up. 
- You can buffer E into K'Sante W (make sure your E hits during the dash, not the channel). The timing on this buffer is a little tricky as he can change how long he holds W
   - This interaction makes it hard for K'Sante to ever ult you/force the all-in, as you can phase rush to safety during the stun
- Just try your best to interact minimally and keep your farm even. K'Sante is one of the few champs that can beat Urgot at 9/Black Cleaver

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always be mindful of your Phase Rush cooldown, if it's down it's really easy for K'Sante to Q -> W -> R chain slow you down, especially with Icebourne Gauntlet
- A good K'Sante can buffer his R into your W, so even if you E buffer his W, he can W -> R and cancel your E 
- If he Q3's you under your tower, you have to E AWAY FROM HIM, or else he can W-> R you over the wall
- He has no mana costs in Ult form, so don't get baited by him appearing OOM
- Watch your positioning near walls when trying to trade/gank K'Sante. Don't give him a R kidnap angle if your jungle ganks

TIPS
- Outscaling K'Sante in the 1v1 is really hard, even at 9/Black Cleaver.  His W is hard for Urgot to dodge, but he's much clunkier in teamfights and falls off hard then compared to Urgot
- His W does not immune him from your R2, it will just delay the pull until his W animation completes'

- Lee Sin looks to perma push/out sustain, hard to trade 

- Don't E if he has W up

- Make sure you dodge his E radius, look to Q + PTA afterwards

- Can E into his Q2, but usually they'll W out trying to bait it
'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,495 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E92: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind him and fight level 1, but only a small Auto -> E -> Auto PTA trade. Don't extend the trade for his Conq + 2nd Q rotation

HOW TO TRADE
- Lee Sin top looks to waveclear/poke with E, and outsustain with W. Doesn't really play for the 1v1
- Everytime he walks up look to Q -> PTA/Leg combo. Can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all in at 6 if hes ~70%HP
   - Again, he has a lot of sustain with W and no mana costs, so don't force it unless he's taken a lot of damage
- Be careful of his E radius, he will spam it on the wave, make sure it doesn't hit you as well
- You cannot E him if he has W up + minions nearby to dash to
- If he ever Q -> Q2s you, you can E into him and chunk him hard. They usually won't do this though unless it's guaranteed lethal
- You can buffer E into Lee Sin kick (R), the timing is a little tricky though. Pay attention on ganks/trades when they make it obvious they want to kick you
   - Especially if they Q onto you while getting ganked, be ready to E backwards if he tries to ward hop -> R behind you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q -> Q2 -> Ward hop mid animation to bait out your E

TIPS
- This pick isn't very common anymore, and it's rather weak. It's hard to win lane as he's very slippery and has high sustain, but you omega outscale him in the 1v1 and in teamfights.
- As long as you don't give him kills in lane, it's a useless pick

- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, but need AP to kill him in teamfights'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,496 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E95: Details='EARLY GAME
- Malphite is really weak level 1, look to get behind him and fight. If he does not facecheck the bush and get into E range, careful to not let him just Q you for free and run away with the MS
- If he has E start, look to Auto -> Flip -> Make space so he can't E -> Auto -> Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- If Malphite ever gets in E range, look to flip, especially if you have legs/equal items
- This is a poke lane, try your best to use TP + Cull + Dblade + Pots to stay health enough to eat farm until 9/Black Cleaver
   - Really important to save your TP to reset for when he pokes you out too hard.
- Malphite will max range Q + Comet you on repeat until you're in lethal. You can't really interact since max range Q + MS lets him kite your E
   - TAKE CONTROL OF THE BRUSHES, don't let him Q you for free. Make him work for it.
   - Early on, E for the shield + Auto + Leg whenever he walks up to Q you
   - You're playing to outsustain his mana pool
- If he has no Q, you can look to Q->PTA/Leg trade, or even Q->E Flip. Careful if you flip pre-9, Malphite in the long lane with armor (Warden's Mail, etc) can run you down and kill you
- Once you break his shield, try to hit him with autos to keep it ticking. Be careful of overusing mana in this lane, as you can't really kill.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Malphite is really hard to kill after his first base for armor. Try to get as much of a lead as you can before then.
- Malphite is really strong level 6+ with an Armor Component, don't ego and just focus on keeping your farm up
- If Malphite rushes Thornmail, it's really hard to win 1v1, even at Black Cleaver. Pray you have AP Carries and play to eat farm + teamfight, not 1v1

TIPS
- Level 1-2, Malphite Q costs a ton of mana and only is worth for him if he has Comet + Manaflowbind up. Stand in front of him and try to baitt him to Q you when those are down 
- If Malphite goes grasp, it's a free win. If they have to actually auto/enter your E range, you can hard win trades
- Don't toggle at level 9+ if he has E attack speed slow on you
- It's hard to kill Malphite, but it's hard for Malphite to kill you, and you outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver. In teamfights, as long as you have some magic damage, you're more useful
- His ult cannot immune Urgot R2, it will execute him after the animation

- Hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver and for rest of game. 

- Maokai has insane teamfighting, so play sidelane'
2025-05-04 23:11:08,497 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E98: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Maokai and trade hard, buffer his Q with your E if you can get close enough. 
- Try to deny the first 3 EXP or CS, you should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Maokai is short range, just play around his Smash (Q). 
- Wiggle around his max Q range, it's a bit longer than your auto range. Look for Q->PTA/Leg trade if he misses/uses Q
   - Usually Maokai CS'es with Q, so look for trades everytime he does so. USE YOUR RANGE
- You can look to Q->E combo Maokai and buffer his E through his Q. Make sure close the gap as much as possible before Eing, it makes it easier to buffer E
- If he ever Roots (W) you, E BEHIND YOURSELF to Flip him after he becomes targetable again
- Don't let him get free Grasp + passive autos and free Q poke on you, and he has no tools to fight back. 
   - Deny him CS and outscale


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Maokai W can dodge your E and your R, be careful E'ing Maokai normally. 
   - If his W is up, E + Flash or look to BUFFER E THROUGH HIS Q
   - Also do not R Maokai unless he's E stunned, or wait for him to get out of range so he has no W targets
- Maokai has really nice gank setup, get vision out after you crash waves to not die to jungle
- From 7-9, Maokai (with 4 points Q) with armor items/bami is actually strong, respect until 9

TIPS
- This is a relatively easy tank lane, he has a lot less laning pressure than most tanks but better scaling. 
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, and decisively win 1v1 the rest of the game. However, his teamfight power is better than yours so really look to establish AT LEAST a CS lead in lane
- Try to play side lane vs Maokai later on as he wants to only teamfight

2025-05-04 23:11:08,498 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E101: Details='EARLY GAME
- If you have Ignite, you can look to fight Mordekaiser early. 
- However, Mordekaiser lvl 1 is no joke. You have to get the jump on him Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA, and kite with your legs. 
   - His passive + Conq + 2nd Q cast can make it a close fight
- Usually, just look to E thru the first 3 melees and FLIP Mordekaiser as he Qs them -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage 
   - If you can Flip him here into a chunk, it's huge for your lane
- Should get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- After the first 3 levels, Mordekaiser stat checks you until 9/Black Cleaver
- Your goal is to not contest/play aggro unless he's ~60% HP and in oneshot E + Flash + Ignite + R range. 
   - Look for small Q/Leg poke, but do not E forwards or play too aggro when he's higher HP.
   - His shield + Conq makes him really tanky after your E burst, you usually can't kill and then he ramps up and kills you
- Play around his Q, wiggle around its range and try to bait it out. 
   - If he uses/misses Q, look for a short Q->PTA/leg trade. 
- If he ever wastes shield (W) you can look to heavy trade/all-in if hes ~70%HP
- If he holds shield (W), hold your E in all-ins until hes around ~40% HP so you can burst him below execute 25% range during your E stun. 
   - Even if he shields after, your R will still execute him
- If he ever E's you and you can't dodge it, buffer E away 
   - You can "ride" his scoop (E) with your E, useful in flipping him under tower if he doesn't know

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL IN THE LONG LANE. Mordekaiser can just walk up -> R -> EQ  and force the all in from Full HP. Even if he can't kill you, you will lose way too much HP
- Mordekaiser shield (W) makes him deceptively tanky, be patient with your R after you Flip as he can time it out easily
- Use your Flash to dodge one of his Qs if he all-ins you
- Be careful of him using his Ult to trap you and setup a jungle gank

TIPS
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you, you literally can't fight pre-9 if he's equal pre-9
   - If the wave is pushing away from you, STAND ON YOUR MINIONS and bait him to Q you to push it back
- You can actually complete your R2 as he ults, you can yoink him out of his death realm (R)
- Really difficult lane, but it's Urgot favored at 9/Black Cleaver if you play the fight well. After level 13 and 2 items you hard outscale Mordekaiser for the rest of the game.
   - Mordekaiser is also not a great champ, he's really weak to ranged/kiting. If you fall behind, don't worry if your comp isn't 4+ melees.'

- Look to get behind Nasus and fight level 1, ZONE HIM OFF THE FIRST 3 MELEE EXP. 
- If he walks up past you, try to flip him back towards his tower and PTA chunk for 70% of his HP
- If you chunked hard, look for E + Flash + W + Ignite kill at level 2. If there is no angle, look to freeze/setup a gank after the wave crashes then bounces back
   - As it bounces back, you can walk behind the wave (make sure you don't have minion aggro) and fight/zone off Nasus again
- Trading/deny EXP level 1 is critical in this lane, or else you can't punish Nasus pre-6.  You want to either take his HP and TP, or make him lose EXP.
   - Once he hits 6 the matchup gets really hard in an isolated 1v1 without a lead.

HOW TO TRADE
- Pre-6, if Nasus ever walks up, look to Q->E->Trade as hard as possible. 
- After 6, only look to Flip if hes ~60%HP and you have Ignite/items. His R is an insanely powerful 1v1 tool
   - Just look for Q->Leg/PTA trades until he's low enough to all-in
- Usually Nasus goes 3/4 points E with Dring/Tear, and just stands 10 screens back wave clearing.
   - Not much counterplay to this strat, do your best to dodge the E (impossible challenge)
   - MAKE HIM CHOOSE BETWEEN E'ING YOU OR THE WAVE: Stand on the side of the lane, and look to Q->Trade if he E's the wave
   - Preserve your HP vs this setup: don't overly force the freeze if your jungle isn't nearby
   - His stacks are low with this setup, but he can get CS/EXP. 
- If you haven't found a lead pre-6, play to just farm up until 9/Black Cleaver when you beat Nasus again.
   - Even if you found a lead, you can still easily lose at Nasus 6 + Sheen, focus on growing your CS lead, or chunking him out hard if you want to all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If Nasus runs Phase Rush, respect the cooldown before looking to all-in/R, as it also gives slow resist after
- Nasus R gives him lots of Resists + HP, so don't R too early or it will time out
- His wither (W) slow is really strong at setting up ganks, don't overextend looking too hard to trade

TIPS
- Don't toggle W if you are withered, just leave W on
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver, but eventually in the 1v1 he outscales depending on his stacks.
   - But your teamfight is much better than his due to Urgot's CC, just focus on E/Ring him when your team can focus him down

- If she has Q start, you can look to Auto -> E to gap close/shield -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage for a nice chunk 
- If she has clone (W) start, it's a little trickier as she can run out of your auto range. If she starts Dblade, she will usually start clone (W). You can still fight tho, just try to hold your E to bait out her W first
- If you can't trade level 1, focus on using brushes to avoid autos and match her push as best you can

HOW TO TRADE
- Neeko's high range/poke makes this matchup hard, you can only poke with Q
- Do your best to avoid her Q/E/Empowered W Auto
   - If she misses/uses E, you can look for a Q->PTA/Leg trade
   - If she has E up, try to dodge her Q and look for Q poke in return
   - Stand in brushes/respect when has empowered W auto up
- If you can poke her down enough, look for E + Flash + R + Ignite one shot
- I like to go early Dirk/AD items + Ignite in this matchup so I can flash her from high HP. Playing slow lets her poke you down too much, her Q is really hard to dodge
- If you're fast with E + Flash, you will still Flip her even if she clones as you Flip
- If you Flash to kill, make sure you have lethal. Her Clone + E + R can time out/disengage easily, and without Flash you can't play the game for 5 minutes

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful overextending a trade, as her W clone + MS can outrange you easily
- Neeko W can bodyblock your R and E

TIPS
- Count the minions to see if she's invisible, press tab and if her portrait lights up but you don't see her, she's disguised somewhere
- Always remember that if you "see" the enemy jungle on minimap, it could be Neeko. Don't think you're safe from jungle ganks.
- You can buffer E through her E and R

- Level 1 look to fight him before minions spawn, BUT DO NOT FIGHT PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE
   - Auto -> Try to get behind him and E him towards his tower -> Auto -> Phase Rush and disengage
   - If you look for anything more, he can ghost/Q chain slow you and win, as his Ghost lasts longer than Phase Rush
- If you don't fight before minions arrive, look to E Flip him as he CS'es the first 3 and Phase Rush away
- You should always get level 2 prio. Trading hard level 1 sets up a level 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill, which makes this lane A LOT easier

HOW TO TRADE
- You are actually stronger in this matchup pre-6, but once Olaf hits 6 NEVER INTERACT UNTIL 9/Black Cleaver
- Pre-6, look to use your range and Q+Legs to trade hard. 
   - Don't commit your E unless he's low enough to burst in W with Ignite, he gets too much lifesteal + shielding at low HP
   - If he's ~30-40% HP, and you have Ignite + Legs up, you can look to commit to an all-in 
- If Olaf has Ghost/TP, play for prio and call your jungler to gank when the wave bounces back. He has no counterplay to your E + Flash, and then you get his TP on a frozen wave
   - If Olaf has Ghost/Flash, can do the same play, they usually won't react to E + Flash. 
      - Look to kill, or at least chunk and force him to base on a frozen wave with no TP
      - Be a little careful, as if you Flash too early and he's not low enough, he can trade 1 for 1
- If he throws his axe (Q) too far away, look for a Q->Leg trade, he has no all-in threat if he can't pick up his axe
- Post-6, always look to hold the wave and freeze. Be careful when the wave is pushing out. OLAF WANTS THE LONG LANE TO GHOST/Q YOU DOWN IN AN ALL-IN
   - If the wave starts pushing out, stand in your minions and bait him to Q so it pushes back to you
   - Never walk into his Q range unless you have PHASE RUSH up
- Most Olafs will panic R when you R them if they're in execute hp. 
   - Hold your R2, Olafs ult will time out and then you can R2 him in for the execute
- Try to bait him to all in you, then use Phase Rush/E to disengage. He is much weaker without his Ult than you post-9
- You can win at level 9/Black Cleaver vs Olaf if you have Ignite + get the first jump on him, but you will lose if he can instantly melee range/fight you. 
   - Use your range + Phase Rush movement speed to space him

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Olaf R prevents you from E'ing or R executing him, which is why this matchup is hard
- He gets increased lifesteal/shielding when low, you NEED ANTI-HEAL (Ignite or item) to kill at any point in the game
- His ult lasts for as long as he can auto, so try to disengage ASAP to let it time out
- It's often not worth to get your jungler to gank Olaf until 9/Black Cleaver, you don't have any damage/CC thru his R and he can 1v2 easily


TIPS
- You can use Ignite for Nimbus Cloak MS as another disengage tool if your Phase Rush is down
- Olaf R costs 100 mana, so he runs into a lot of mana issues nowdays if he spams axe (Q). If he has <100 mana, can look to E + Flash + R even when he's 6
- You CAN win past 9 if played well, but it's still a 50-50. Unless you're ahead, Olaf's 1v1 is always strong vs Urgot, but his teamfighting is much worse usually.
   - Focus on getting through lane even, then being more useful in 5v5s'

- Look to fight Ornn level 1 with Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA disengage. 
- Ornn doesn't really take a lot of damage, so focus on CSing over trading in this lane after the level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- Interacting with Ornn before 9/Black Cleaver is always negative. We can never flip forwards in this lane, just farm up and outscale
   - His ability to build items in lane means you have to preserve your TP and TAKE RESETS WHEN YOU CAN
   - He only takes damage before he buys, once he has any armor component/bamis he is exodia
- His Q is his main poke ability + sets up larger trades with Q->E. Focus on dodging the Q damage and move away from the pillar immediately
   - Ornn's will usually throw Q to CS, so don't stack on top of your minions
- If Ornn ever looks to Q->E combo you, be ready to buffer E away to deny an extended trade from him
- Ornn breath (W) will deny your Flip, but HE WILL STILL BE STUNNED AFTER. If you E -> Ornn Ws, insta click away while he's stunned so he can't brittle auto you
- If you do have to fight, try to walk behind him as he W's to avoid the Brittle
- If he does waste his Q, W, or E, you can look for Q->PTA/Leg trades before he can W you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always look to stop him from building for free when you can by hitting him. Try to make him choose between building really far away and giving CS/EXP.
   - Some Ornn's will fake build in your face to bait you into Q->E range, or to waste your mana. 
   - Sometimes just standing close to Ornn without hitting/Qing is enough to stop his build
- Ornn's triple brittle combo with Ult legit can oneshot you from 80%HP if you're overextended. Do not disrespect Ornn's damage post-6
- You can buffer E into Ornn's Brittle auto knockback, but the timing is tricky. If you E too early he can knockdown your E with the auto
- If you have Brittle on you, if you're on top of Ornn's Q as it spawns, it will literally push you and consume the Brittle proc for damage


TIPS
- When Ornn summons his R, look to E or E + Flash before he gets it off, if they W they can't recast R2
- Ornn W will not deny your R2, it will execute after his W animation
- After level 9, Most Ornn's will use their E to run away. If you're fast enough, you can Q->E and grab him out of his E since it has an animation delay
- You hard outscale Ornn after 9/Black Cleaver as you can take extended trades now, and you outscale 1v1 for the rest of the game. He does bring equal teamfight value though, so if you can play sidelane it's better

- If Pantheon has Ignite + Conq, do not fight early game, his Q does too much damage
- If he has TP, You can look for Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage
- Prio can go either way in this matchup, just really focus on not taking too many Qs level 1. He can space your E with his Q, so if you don't get the angle don't force it and preserve HP
   - REALLY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T OVERAGGRO LEVEL 1 AND LOSE FREE HP TO PANTH Q, ITS TOO HIGH RANGE/LOW CD TO OUTPLAY

HOW TO TRADE
- You can't really force trades if he has Q, it outranges you. Try to wiggle at his Q range, and if you dodge it look for a Q->PTA/Leg combo.
   - This lane just comes down to respecting his Q poke and range until you outscale.
- You can buffer E into his W, just be on the look out for it as it comes fast
   - Pre-9 however you don't want to E forwards unless hes ~60-70% HP, as he can kill you with Conq + Q + Ignite 
   - Post-9, if you E his W you insta kill him
- Just play slow and look to small trade with Q/Legs while dodging his Qs. If he wastes E, or he's <60%HP you can look to one shot with E + Flash + Ignite + R
- His E CAN Block your R2, and a lot of your E + Flash damage, but usually they will E the wrong way.
   - If they E towards you -> You E Flip them -> you can deal damage as they're E'ing the wrong way now
- If you look to Flip -> all-in with R, only press R once so you can wait for his E to expire

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- RESPECT HIS EMPOWERED Q EXECUTE DAMAGE. It does a lot with Ignite, you never want to be <50%HP in lane vs Panth
- Spam ping if he goes MIA, his R is a strong ganking tool on mid lane
- His Q is actually really hard to dodge front-to-back, it's long. If you have to walk into his Q range, try dodging side to side

TIPS
- Pantheon is strong level 1-5, but falls off around level 6f as you get a combat ult and he doesn't. 
- He gets hard outscaled by level 9/Black Cleaver and is way weaker in 1v1s/teamfiights for the rest of the game.
- His strength is snowballing off his early game, and collecting kills around the map, so focus on not dying/getting poked out and farming'

- As the minions crash, they usually CS the first 3 with Q. Try to E -> PTA -> Disengage
- If she's not giving you E range, use your E for gapclose/shield -> Auto + Leg if she throws her buckler (Passive) auto at you

HOW TO TRADE
- Play slow in this lane, use your range + autos to do work, if she can hit you back with Q+ Passive it's losing
- When she has her buckler (Passive up), stay in bush/give CS until she consumes it. Earlier in the game you can E just to shield the damage -> Auto + Leg
- You can never E Poppy when she has her circle (W) up, but it does have a higher CD than your E
   - Against worse players, you can look to test their reactions on W level 1-3. Sometimes they won't press it, especially if you're a little closer to them
- BE TIGHT WITH YOUR SPACING. Poppy Q is about the same range as your auto, very slightly shorter 
   - When she walks up, Q->Leg/PTA trade, but be sure to use max range auto so she can't Q you
- If she's ~60% HP or wastes W, you can look for E + Flash + R kill. 
   - The best Poppys can W your E + Flash, so be respectful depending on your Elo
- If you can kill, lead with R -> They will channel R -> Buffer Poppy R with your E -> Kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Poppys will use their E on minions as a gapcloser/escape
   - Be careful of Poppy E'ing a minion -> right on top of you for Q -> you can't E because she has W
   - Also be careful of E + Flashing when she has a minion to E to for escape
- Always pay attention to how close you are to walls for her E, she does too much damage if she gets the stun off. 
   - The upper walls of top lane are closer than they seem
- Without flash up, you can't live a gank vs Poppy + Jungler as you can't E away and she can perma slow you

TIPS
- You can buffer Poppy E and R with your E. Both are tricky timings, especially the E
   - You need fast reactions for Poppy E bufer. Whenever you walk near a wall, just hover your E button. You will still get stunned, but you'll also Flip + Stun Poppy
   - Poppy R is a little easier, give some space so you can react
- YOU CAN FLIP (E) POPPY WITH HER CIRCLE (W) ON, IF YOU ARE ON TOP OF HER MODEL. 
   - If you are that close, it will insta flip, so it's not considered a dash, but you have to be RIGHT ON HER MODEL.
   - If she E+W,  you can buffer E into her E and W won't knock you down as you are close enough
- Recasting R2 will cancel knockbacks, so if Poppy has R'ed you while you R2 execute someone, it will put you back on the ground 
- Poppy always has relevancy due to her W, but you hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver'

- Level 1, try to get behind Quinn and E her. 
- They usually don't get in E range, so try to predict buffer E into her E. 
   - They usually Auto -> E, so try to time it after the first Auto
   - If you buffer successfully she literally just dies level 1
- If you can't, just try to take brush and match her push. Don't take too many free autos.

HOW TO TRADE
- Quinn is really weak to Urgot E as it puts her behind Urgot, so she can't E away like normal
- Stand behind minions to dodge her blind (Q) and Q poke until shes 75% HP, then look for E + Flash + R + Ignite oneshot
   - Only go for auto attacks if her Q/E is down
- Buffering E into Quinn E is always a guaranteed kill, but a really hard timing to get down as Quinn E comes out FAST.
   - They usually E after an empowered auto, so look to E around that timing
- If she's even slightly chunked (2-3 Qs), you can one shot at 6 with Ignite + Dirk/AD Components. Don't be afraid to just E + Flash
- It's important you don't waste your E, as she can take all your HP running you down with her MS + Passive autos

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q'ing against good Quinns, they can E OVER it and dodge it.
   - For some real mindgames, if they do this, you can buffer E as soon as you Q, that way if they E to dodge your Q you Flip them
- Her level 6 is really annoying for just roaming, make sure to spam your mid/jungle to be careful
- Keep her W vision reveal in mind when trying to cheese, I like to stand in the Alcove or really far back so she can't spot me

TIPS
- If you E + Flash Quinn, make sure to keep kiting towards her tower so she can't E to safety
- If you get a lead on Quinn, it's really hard for her to play 1v1, and you one shot her with E the entire game. She will just try to roam around the map, so make sure you punish if she does'

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is weird, you can only look to trade when his W isn't on. 
- If he has W on, only auto attack him if you have a leg up
- Look to trade and bait ous his W. Wait for his W to expire before dumping Q + PTA + W on him. 
   - If he takes enough damage with W down, you can kill with R
- Just use your range + autos whenever you can, try not to commit too much mana as he's hard to kill
- It's actually not that bad of a matchup because he has no kill pressure, just annoying. Just farm up and scale
- If you can flip him in front of tower with W on, you can kill him as he will get aggro

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- MAKE SURE YOU TURN W OFF BEFORE HE TAUNTS (E) YOU. You will insta die as each of your W ticks make you take full damage from his W + Thornmail
- His R is a pretty fast dash, so be patient with your R or wait for your E stun
- They usually look for the proxy, try to ward the river so you can see if he tries to. If you have an AP Jungler you can easily kill him.

TIPS
- Rammus is an easy lane, but even if he's 0-10 he will be UNKILLABLE if you don't have consistent AP damage (Azir good, Nidalee bad)
   - I would dodge if we were 3-4+ AD champs
- You never can really kill Rammus after he gets Thornmail, he just gets too much armor. Play to E/R him in teamfights where your AP champs can hit him'

HOW TO TRADE
- Use your range in this matchup, Q + PTA/Leg trade every time she tries to walk up for CS
- If you E first while Rek'Sai is burrowed, she can cancel it with burrowed W (knockup), so it's hard to E aggressively in this lane.
   - If she is unborrowed and below 70%, you can look to E. 
- If Rek'Sai tries to knock you up (W) first, you can buffer E and flip her. Be prepared for this if she tunnels (E) at you
- Realistically save E for E + Flash when she's around 50% HP.
   - She has to be lower than usual because she can time out your R with her R animation
- Her main tool is her SUSTAIN. Keep your spacing tight and don't enter her melee Q range, and you should always win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rek'Sai R can actually dodge your R2 if timed properly
- She can set up ganks really well with her tunnels, so respect jungle

TIPS
- This is a rather useless pick nowadays, it's weak in lane and gets MASSIVELY outscaled by Urgot in 1v1 and teamfights.

- Usually they start E, so Auto -> E backwards to try to predict his E through you. Even if you can't catch him with E, the free autos is still decent
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Renekton's has good short trades, good long trades (Conq + R), and high sustain (Q). He is a lane bully, so our primary goal should be to go even until 9/Black Cleaver
- Pay attention to his fury. If he has low fury, you can play aggressive with Q + PTA/Leg trades when he steps up. If he has high fury you have to respect
- Be tight with your spacing, try to get Q/Auto poke while avoiding his Q
- Buffering E into Renekton stun (W) is a good window to trade, they look to E->W (buffer E before they can E out)
   - HOWEVER, don't E forwards in the long lane if he's level 6 and now <60%HP, as his Ult + Conq can run you down
- Good Renketons will mix up his trading pattern, E-> Q -> E is hard to react to, just try to space his initial E
- Don't try to over trade in this lane, he has a lot of sustain, no mana, and stronger trades.

HOW TO TRADE
- Rengar's W makes every trade winning for him before you have antiheal, game plan is to keep bushes warded and stand on the far side so he can't jump you
- AVOID FIGHTING NEAR BUSHES. Look to just play slow and scale up, if he gives you angles to poke take them and you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot if hes <60% HP.
   - Just make sure he has low ferocity stacks, as he can Empowered W your R2
- RUSH ANTIHEAL. Once you get antiheal you can take more aggressive trades, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade after he jumps to CS a minion. 
   - You can even try to predict E as he jumps

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rengar Empowered W can cleanse your Flip, stun, AND R2. Make sure to keep track of his ferocity when R/E'ing
- If you ward the brush and rengar sees it, he can insta oneshot it with Q. Make sure when you ward the brush he doesn't see it
- Spam ping when he goes MIA, his Ult is great at ganking your jungle/mid

- This lane is based around her shield (E) CD. If it's up you have to respect and can't commit your E
- Look to Flip (E) on her stun (W) or Q3.
   - Q3 is riskier to E at, as it's higher range, and she can E away before your E connects, Don't recommend E'ing Riven's Q3 unless they're noobs
   - Better Rivens will look to E forwards -> W -> Auto -> Q out. Be prepared to flip during E->W, you will kill if you do this, but the timing is hard

- A good Riven will be hard to kill, so just focus on applying pressure with your auto + Q range. Build a CS lead and outscale.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL TO NOT LET HER BAIT YOUR E, IF YOU MISS E YOU DIE. 
- Riven is one of the best proxy champs, don't let her as she can easily kill your Jungler. Try to put vision in river and watch her if she tries to go around
- Do not underestimate Conq + Ignite + Level 6 Riven, she can kill you from 80%HP

TIPS
- This matchup is generally good for Urgot as he wins early + outscales, but Riven can definitely outplay at 6 with Ignite.  
   - If you fight anywhere not near your tower, be careful that she can just flash your E if you all-in (even from full HP)
- The longer the game goes the harder you outscale.  Hitting E on Riven in teamfights = instakill.
- CC absolutely fucks Riven, if you can pair Urgot with any CC jungler (Vi, Taliyah, etc) she cannot play'

- At level 6, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill if hes ~70%HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he's near OVERHEAT, if you look to E + Flash and don't kill him in the Stun, his overheat autos HURT
- Dodge his E's, if he can hit both on you they shred a lot of MR and you get oneshot
- Rumble Q and E DO NOT DRAW MINION AGGRO, so don't feel too safe in a big wave.

TIPS
- It's quite hard to dodge Rumble E due to your large hitbox, standing behind minions is your best bet 
- If you Flip Rumble in Q, his Q will not face you, you can reduce some damage in the all-in this way
- If you fall behind/struggle, sitting on a Negatron Cloak isn't bad
- You outscale Rumble at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind, and demolish him as the game goes on in 1v1/teamfights. Going down 20CS in this lane is fine, just focus on getting EXP and not dying'

- You can buffer Q->E into his W root if you're fast, he's low range

- If you land E you can always kill, but Ryze scales harder than Urgot

- Level 1 look to get behind him and fight. Usually he will start W, so if he doesn't enter E range, just Auto -> E to Gapclose/shield -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Play for level 2 prio, should get it
- If he's chunked enough, look to E + Flash + W level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Ryze outranges you and has strong poke, as well as strong disengage with W + Phase Rush
- Stand behind minions and look for Q poke. 
   - If he has no angle to bounce/hit Q on you, can extend Q->PTA/Leg trade
- If he gives range, Look to Q->E gapclose 
   - When you get near with Q slow + Approach Velocity MS, most Ryze's will try to root
   - BUFFER E THROUGH RYZE ROOT to hard win the trade. It's the same range as your E so if you E as soon as you're in range to flip, it will go thru usually
- Repeat until he's ~60%HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal
- Lane is tricky, especially because Ryze goes HP in Catalyst/ROA so he's hard to oneshot
- Don't overforce, if you take too much poke it's hard to play the all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Respect his ability to kite you with Phase Rush, W slow, and range.
- Be careful of standing too close to minions, Ryze can E->Q chain off the minions to hit you
- If you look to E + Flash + R, be aware that you only have 2s to kill with R, as he will Ult out himself

TIPS
- Merc Treads rush helps a ton in landing E. 
- Ryze scales really well, harder than Urgot, but post 9 (and especially if you get movement speed items like Youmuu's) you one shot him 1v1. 
- As long as you can get on top of Ryze and Flip, you win.'

EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Sejuani and fight level 1. If she starts her Flail (W) just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- If she starts Q, she can knockdown your E. Look to trade Autos 
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Play around her W, it's her main damage ability. If she uses it, kite side to side to dodge it
   - When it's on cooldown look for Q->PTA/Leg trade
- You can Buffer her Dash (Q) with E, they usually don't Q in but be ready to Flip if she does
- Be ready to buffer E away from her R or stun (E). She has really low kill threat in lane but sets up ganks extremely well
- Maintain your spacing, and play to punish her on every CS with Q/Autos. As long as you don't eat too many Ws, she can't do much and you outscale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E at her first, she can knock it down with Q.
- Her burst damage with R + Ignite + her full combo does a lot of damage, don't disrespect if you're ~60%HP

TIPS
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game 1v1. She has good utility in teamfights, but yours is better. Try to play sidelane as you are much stronger there

- Be careful in fighting Sett level 1, he's strong with W + Conq. 
- As the minions crash, auto him once. If you see his Grit stack, disengage (he has W) and just play for push, small chip autos.
- If it doesn't, he has E and you can look to Auto -> Flip -> Auto Auto PTA. 
   - Try to buffer E through his E
- You should always get level 2 prio as long as you don't give him a big W charge

HOW TO TRADE
- Don't let him stack W. Look for small Q + PTA trades, then insta disengage before he can E->W you.
   - If he Ws, you will have enough range to dodge the center by moving side to side
- Sett has long CDs, but it's hard to make him use them unfavorably. Just farming and outscaling in this matchup is good
   - Of course if he does waste his W, you can look to take a big trade. 
- Never E forwards aggressively until 9/Black Cleaver unless he's chunked. He has really good extended trades with Conq + W
- If he tries to Q for MS -> E you to force trades, be ready to buffer E away. If you can do this, he can't ever force trades on you. 
- If hes ~40-50% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R one shot before he can W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He has really high sustain when he gets low, if you don't have Ignite, don't overforce trying to kill him without E unless you have R to execute
- Sett R cancels your E completely, so be careful E'ing around him.
- Also be careful when E'ing forwards in lane, as he can ult you back into his tower/side of the map to extend the trade

TIPS
- You can actually flip Sett as he W's behind you, so that his W completely misses. However this is risky as the timing has to be clean, and if he combos E->W it could mess it up
- You are stronger at 9/Black Cleaver, but nothing too crazy. As the game goes on you destroy him, especially if you can bait out/dodge the W, he has nothing
- In teamfights just make sure you don't give Sett an angle to R you into your backline
   - If you E->R Sett in fights with followup, often you can 1shot him so fast they can't even press W

- Look to just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA as he tries to CS the first 3 creeps
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is all about spacing and playing your range + autos. Shen should never be able to walk up and Q + Grasp auto you
   - His Q does give him 50 more AA range
- You can buffer E into his taunt (E). Early game if they are aggro they might taunt you, be ready to buffer E 
   - If he's close to you, buffer E backwards.
   - If he's farther away, you can buffer E at him
- Don't lead with E in trades, as he can W or E away himself.
- If you flip him, hold W for after his W. They usually will drop their zone (W) immediately
- Shen's laning power is really low. It's important you focus on wave management. 
   - You always want to SLOW PUSH, to be able to crash a big wave and deny Shen EXP/CS if he Ults away at 6
      - You can also freeze, but pushing is way better
- SPAM PING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF SHEN ULT WHEN HE HITS 6, THE ONLY THING SHEN CAN DO IS MAKE YOUR TEAM LOSE (Which is pretty big)

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Shen's Q does more damage if he drags it through your body (it also slows you if you are running away)
- Shen can nullify you in teamfights quite hard with his Ult + W + Taunt to deny your E and R

TIPS
- I like Demolish in this matchup as you can take a plate or 2 every time he Ults away
- Once you hit 9, if Shen just sits under his tower, look to proxy waves and create tempo on the map so he can't R away easily
- Bone Plating is decent over Overgrowth if you struggle in this lane, denies his Taunt (E) trade hard'

- WALK WITH YOUR WAVE LEVEL 1. DO NOT LET SINGED PROXY!
- If Singed starts in lane, just walk at him and fight him ASAP. He's so weak level 1, you cook him if you hit E
   - Be careful if Singed Qs the wave, if you miss E/get kited, he can hit level 2 fast

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is super easy. You outrange and bully Singed, ouscale him, and can even deny his Flip (E) with your own E buffer
- Watch out for 3 things:
   1) Singed E + Flash into his W ground under his tower
        - If you are careful with your autos/read his body language for when he wants to Flash, this is easily outplayable
   2) Singed getting to Proxy
        - NEVER GRIEF YOUR TEMPO, WARD THE RIVER/WRAP AROUND ENTRANCES, AND KEEP PUSHING HIM IN OR FREEZING
        - Conciously think about how Singed could potentially proxy you and look to stop it. 
        - Singed can only play the game if he can proxy, so you want to deny him the proxy AT ALL COSTS
   3) Jungle ganks
        - He has really good gank setup, so try to get deep vision out before you push Singed in
- If you don't blunder those 3 things, Singed can literally not play. Use your Range and punish/deny him off every CS With Q + PTA/Leg trades
- You can buffer his E by E'ing backwards.Uno Reverse you flip him instead
- You can buffer E while his W goo is midair, so he can't ground you from Eing

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Read the above section
- Conq Ignite Singed can be quite scary at level 6. 

TIPS
- Singed will usually have to give up EXP/CS and roam a lot in this matchup. Give your mid/bot lots of MIA pings
- If Singed is in the proxy position, it's worth giving a wave to push him out if your jungle is on your side. If you can't, look to proxy yourself if you're level 9
- You hard outscale Singed, but he provides lots of utility in teamfights even if really behind. Look to sidelane a lot, he can't really stop you from just taking the towers'

- Level 1 look to fight, just look for Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage trade
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Like most tank lanes, this matchup is not bad until Sion gets his first armor item on base (esp Steelcaps or Wardens mail)
- Sion can space and take small trades vs Urgot really easily with his E/Q knockup/W shield
   - It's hard for Urgot to outplay. We just look to not interact and outscale
- If he wastes Q or W, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade
- Unless Sion is chunked or really behind, don't E forwards unless near your tower. He's so tanky you're never killing, and he can win the extended trade with his 2nd Q rotation
- The only interaction is trying to buffer Sion Q with E, but it's really hard as Sion can release Q at any point
   - This buffer interaction takes a lot of experience to know when to "time" your E
   - You can try to time it on the max charged Sion Q (it's always the same time), but that's risky since it will do a lot of damage + Stun you for a longer time. Generally not worth to go for
   - The closer you are to Sion the easier it is to buffer E, max range Es into his Q are much easier for him to knockdown. 
- Approach Velocity is clutch in this matchup as you can gapclose Q->E fast enough before he can charge his Q enough

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Pay attention to your minions, Sion will try to E them thru you to slow so he can trade with his Q
- Sion R can immune your R2. Generally no way around this since his ult lasts way longer than yours does, you can't just time it out

TIPS
- Try to break his shield (W) before he can activate it, then it does no damage
- You can buffer E into sion R
- You hard outscale Sion with your %HP Legs and Ult. Just make sure you don't fall behind in lane and in teamfights, he's really easy to E->R '

- You can E his E if you time it right before it connects
- He has insane gank setup, so care for jungle

- If he takes a chunk level 1, E + Flash + W + Ignite insta kills him at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really easy matchup, the only thing Sylas can do is max Q and farm from range
- If he ever E2's you, just buffer E into it and he gets 1shot with Ignite
- Don't E if he has E up. Just use your range, Q + Auto + PTA + Legs demolish Sylas, he's really squishy
- Sometimes Sylas will gapclose with W (it's a short dash), if you're ready you can snag them with E on this. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If he is putting points in Q, make sure you are dodging them. The delayed Q explosion does more damage, so don't get hit by that
- Be careful if he can take good ults like Swain or Alistar in teamfights

- Sylas damage is front loaded, and he's pretty squishy if you have Ignite. Don't be afraid of continuing the fight if he gets a good initial trade

HOW TO TRADE
- Stand behind minions so he can't Q you and TK can't interact with you.

- Post level 9, you can take extended trades with him hard, just make sure you don't get kidnapped under tower
- Watch his grey health -> shield when looking to all-in with R. 
   - Try to save your E for when hes ~40% so that even if he shields after, he'll be under the 25% R Execute range still


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- TK's only real kill angle is to Q->R kidnap you under tower.
   - If TK does land Q on you, be very careful. The slow will let him auto you -> Eat (R) you.

- If you ever E him and he blinds you before he gets stunned, hold your W until you are unblinded
- Teemo has high auto range, so TAKE THE BUSH. 
- Rushing merc treads is strong, the extra movement speed helps with combing Q->E and tenacity reduces the blind duration
- Swap to Red trinket at 9 to clear shrooms
- Annoying champ in lane, but falls off hard. You are much stronger in sidelane/teamfights if not behind!

- Don't E forwards pre-9, he can run you down. Be careful in the long lane

- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range
   - Save E > R combo for when he's ~60-70% HP. 
       - Ult won't time out
       - If you insta E, they may insta R, making the 1v1 hard
       - If they hold R, you can 1shot him in the E flip depending on your items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Trundle can cancel your E with his pillar (E) if timed well. 
- Trundle's level 6 is extremely strong 1v1, be very respectful especially if he has ghost + the long lane


TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well
   - If you have enough damage, Trundle gets one shot in your E flip before he can Ult/ramp up'

2025-05-04 23:11:08,524 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E176: Details='EARLY GAME
- Don't fight Tryndamere until minions arrive
- Always start in lane: Don't let Trynda get free fury stacks
- Instantly look to take bush/auto him as he walks up. Don't let him stack fury for free
   - Hold your E, just use your autos. If he spins on you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - If he doesn't spin, push him off CS with your legs/range and get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- You can play really aggressive in this matchup with PTA + Ignite pre-6, but after 6 you have to play a lot more respectful. 
-  His R/sustain counter you from lvl 6-9 just let the wave push into you and farm. They usually hit it a lot to stack fury
- If the wave is pushing out, slow push and build big waves. Stand in front of your minions and try to auto, so he can't stack fury, and hope the wave crashes
- Trade based around his fury:
   - If he has low fury, look to be aggressive and use your Range + Legs to push him off so he can't auto for fury
   - If he has high fury, you have to respect AND HOLD YOUR Q. If he spins on you, use your Q to slow and make space. You don't want to E here or he can run you down/dive you
- Never E forwards if he has ult, high fury, or full HP. Also keep in mind he can E to dodge your E
- HOW TO PLAY THE ALL-IN/DIVE:
   - We want to use the FULL 4s of our R slow + R pull animation to time out his ult
   - Make sure you R him at ~200HP. If R base damage can "kill" Trynda (even if he's in R) it will AUTO PULL. THAT IS BAD.
   - As he dives,  once he's lower: R -> E/Auto to force his R -> Run and let R2 auto time out after 4s -> Pull him in + Ignite -> Hope his R is over
       - Usually Tryndamere will have ~0.5-1s of Ult left, so hit him with an auto and Ignite 
       - MAKE SURE YOU IGNITE AT THE END OF THE FIGHT SO ITS NOT WASTED IN HIS R


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, they will always look to run you down with W slow + Ghost + Lethal Tempo
- Tryndamere has INFINITE SUSTAIN and is hard to all-in because of R. Don't overtrade/OOM yourself with Q/E, just use your Range + Autos
- Tryndamere W is "castable" without needing vision of you. He can tell if you're cheesing in a bush

TIPS
- Try to get Plated Steelcaps first base
- After 9/Black Cleaver you hard outscale for the rest of the game
   - You hard outscale Tryndamere because later on, you do so much damage you force his R in your E flip alone
   - Then you can kite him out easily. You won't kill, but Tryndamere without R IS NOT A CHAMP.'

- If he doesn't facecheck you, it's hard to E due to TF's range. Look to E to gapclose -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- He's really squishy, so if you can trade level 1 he gets oneshot at level 2 with E + F + Ignite + W
- Hard to get prio due to his range, take the bushes and try to match his push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke TF out with Q+Leg Autos until we can E + Flash + R + Ignite at 70%HP
- If he has his card up (W), don't auto, just Q. If he's used it then you can go for a Q -> PTA trade
- Always try to take control of the bush so he can't auto you for free
- Early game his range and damage are quite oppressive, you don't need to force trades. 
    - Level 6 this matchup gets much easier because of your R
- You can buffer E through his gold card, but it still outranges so you won't Flip
   - UNLESS you have a lot of MS, then you can Q->E, but make sure to get really close after Qing and buffer E just as the gold card hits


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-  His damage comes from his E proc, pay attention to when it's up
- Be careful of the Red Card splash damage around minions
- TF has INSANE ROAMS/GANKS with Ghost, his Ult, and Gold card. Really make sure to ping your team so they respect his ganking power

TIPS
- TF is a very summ (ghost/flash) reliant champ, look to punish when they are down (esp if you have Flash up)
- No one really plays AD TF top anymore, but his scaling is still strong if he doesn't fall behind. As long as you hit E + Flash he insta dies though

- Hard to get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- This is an annoying lane, Udyr's R lets him waveclear + trade simultaneously, and his W give him infinite sustain
- Can't really interact, just let him push you in and farm up. You hard outscale
- Pay attention to his Awakened Bar, you can only kill if he's low and not near Awakened W
- Keep your range and don't let him walk up and auto you for free
- Save Phase Rush for when he tries to E stun -> Empowered R you
- It's honestly not worth the mana to Q for damage, you can't really kill until 9/Black Cleaver and he has SO MUCH SUSTAIN

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

- His empowered W gives him a lot of health + big shield, be careful to not get baited

- Set him up for a lvl 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill
- Take bush and try your best to match his push, his range gives him level 2 prio usually

HOW TO TRADE
- Really difficult matchup, Varus's base damage is so high he kind of stat checks you at all points
- If he has Bone Plating, PTA, Barrier it's really difficult as he can fight you early with this setup. Try to get behind him and if you can hit E with Ignite you can still win.
- If he has no barrier, you can 1-shot him with E flash at all points.
- Just look for Q poke when you can and avoid getting into his Auto range
- Rush Dirk for the dirk level 6 Ignite powerspike, so you can oneshot from 80/90% HP.
- If  he messes up spacing and you can gapclose with Q->E, look for that. If he doesn't, really important you don't waste Flash as you need it to one shot. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-If you can't manage to get leads on him early, it's really important you respect his level up timers/range. He deals a ton of damage from a long range, and if you take one bad trade it's hard to overcome that HP difference in an all-in. 

TIPS
- You can buffer your E away if he tries to R you
- You don't outscale Varus, but you can always one shot him if you go damage build. Try to establish a kill or take his flash early so he's vulnerable to ganks/E flash, and if you can't just play conservatively until a window opens up.

- DO NOT PUSH IN THIS MATCHUP EARLY, LET HER PUSH YOU IN.  You cannot crash the wave if you try to push

HOW TO TRADE
- Goal is to poke her to 75% with Q, then look for E + Flash + R oneshot
- When Vayne Qs forward, look to trade with Q+PTA
- If you Q first, Vayne can tumble over your Q and take a good trade
- Save your E + Flash for AFTER she tumbles, or she can dodge it
- If you ever hit E, vayne dies, but you can usually only hit with Flash. If you have enough MS, you can Q->E if she tumbles forward. 
- Do not even try to kill her/trade if your Flash is down, just preserve HP and farm

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- YOU CANNOT KILL VAYNE WITHOUT FLASH. You cannot make a mistake in this lane, and you cannot waste Flash
- Really good Vayne's can buffer condemn (E) into your E + Flash. Don't worry about this too much

TIPS
- Edge of Night first is very good into Vayne, as she can only pop it with her E and if her E is on cd you can run her down
- Vayne scales very hard and has no room for mistakes, even from behind she will be trouble. It just comes down to whether you can land the E on her or not.

HOW TO TRADE
- Wincons in this lane:
    - Constant pressure on Vlad with Q -> leg + auto, especially when his Q is on CD (you can see it's CD from his resource bar), to not let him slowly outsustain you with his healing
    - Not letting him empowered Q you
    - Killing with E flash before he can pool
- If you let Vlad play the slow game and push you in/slowly chip at your HP with Q you will be pushed out of lane and outscaled
- Early on try to test how good his reactions are by Eing at him.
    - Pretend you are disengaging and walk backwards after a Q auto trade, he will walk forwards as you walk back, then E him
    - Against competent Vladimirs though, you will only ever be able to E him before he pools with E + Flash (if the Vladimir is good enough to pool this its gg for you)
- At 70%, look for E + Flash + Ignite + R.
    - Even if he is able to cast pool after your E stun wears off, Ignite will tick him down and you can execute when he resurfaces from W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful not to R2 during his pool animation, as it can block R2

TIPS
- Vladimir likes to run straight at you when he gets his empowered Q ms, this is an easy timing to Q poke him

HOW TO TRADE
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in Autos/Legs without letting him Q
- Your autos barely outrange his Q, so spacing is very important as if he trade autos/Q you lose out eventually
- USE YOUR RANGE, PUSH HIM IN, POKE HIM, BUT DO NOT LET HIM Q YOU! You have to space
- If he walks up to CS, Q->PTA/Leg combo 
- You can use your E to small trade, try to flip him sideways rather than behind you.
   - Make space after you Flip so he can't Q easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he does choose to fight you, trading perma without having lethal is good for Warwick - being half HP or below is Warwick's win con
    - Even if it looks like it's going well at the start Warwick wins lane by being unkillable below 25% HP and then just outsustains you
- DON'T GET BAITED. Warwick wants to be low so he gets more damage + healing, and all his healing/tankiness is backloaded with his R/E
    - Also factor in his BARRIER + E
- Be careful of Warwick getting movement speed in lane early due to your team being low on the map

TIPS

    - If you still have your E up you can threaten E flash ignite R one shot even if you're much lower
    - If you're confident, you can immediately E into his E. If you're fast with it, you can catch him in the E animation before he clones. This is generally risky though so best done later in the game/under your tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Wukong's Q range scales with Q level, and is about the same as your auto range at 9. His main poking pattern in lane is E minion -> Q so watch for this to not get poked down

TIPS
- Ignite early in fights so you cut his conq/passive healing immediately and don't risk igniting his clone
- You can always tell if you E Wukong or his clone, Eing the clone will have a weird "stop" animation and it wont be a fluid E. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN USE R IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FLIP OR NOT
- Outscale at 9/1st item
    - Keep in mind though that Wukong's main strength is his teamfighting, always try to mark him to watch flanks'

- If you pop Yasuo shield passive, can look for Q + PTA trade if he E's near you

- You have to predict Yasuo's dash to hit your E if you want to trade. Usually just E buffer away if he tries to run you down

- His Windwall blocks your entire kit, R1 AND R2

- If he's Q start, you can look to Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage small trade. Try to sidestep his first Q
- If he's E start, he'll dash thru minions. Once you're in range and he wants to dash thru you, E BEHIND YOURSELF

HOW TO TRADE
- Yasuo is a hard matchup as he has infinite dashes to dodge your E, Windwall blocks Q R1 and R2, and shield to win short trades as well while also winning long trades pre-9
- Winning this matchup comes down to being patient with your E, if you hit E you win. 
    - Be aware of your minions to see where he could possibly dash to, try to predict your E to knock him down
    - If you waste your E and he dodges it by dashing through minions you will get run down and die
- Look for E + Flash + R one shot when he's at 60%. 
    - He has to be a little lower than other champs because his windwall will instantly cut off all your damage once he gets unstunned.
- Just let him push you in and farm until you're 9, they usually hit the wave to stack Q


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His windwall will also block your R2 recast, so don't spam R2 unless you can execute him while he's stunned. Try to walk around it so it's not in between you and Yasuo if you can
- Buffering E into his Q3 -> R is really hard. If he tornados you, don't bother buffering E, save it until after his R

TIPS
- Try to take his passive with your leg splash damage
- The 1v1 just comes down to who plays it better/if you hit E post 9

- Buffer E into his Q3, but care if its a max range Q3 as that outranges your E

- Buffer E backwards if he R's you

- You outscale at 9+, and generally outscale him the whole game if you're ahead

- Level 1 you can look to fight Yone, try to sidestep his Q before looking to E. 
- If he doesn't give E range, sidestep Q -> Leg + Auto is also good
- Should get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades are based around Yone W. Try to bait it out, then look for Q->PTA trades
- Never E Yone if he has E up. You want to buffer E when he Q3's forward
   - Be careful as Yone max range Q3 gives him enough space to click back and dodge Urgot E
- If Yone E > Q3s, just E to force his E snapback, or else he can take a beefy trade. 
   - In general, you never really have windows to E yone unless his E is on CD
- Look to E + Flash + R Yone at 70% HP. 
   - If he has E up to dodge your E FLash,  to make it less obvious, Q/Auto trade -> pretend to run away -> E + Flash when he rechases
- Urgot can buffer Yone R by E'ing BACKWARDS

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Until 9, Yone generally has stronger short trades with W, and long trades with lethal tempo. You can't force trades on him
   - Focusing on farming/going even until then is smart
- Be careful on wasting your E, it's really easy for Yone to re-engage with Q3/E and run you down

TIPS
- You smoke Yone after 9/Black Cleaver. I like going a lethality build after that since Yone is a hard scaling tank shredder, he gets one tapped

- You can look to fight Yorick hard early game, if he respects and starts E just play for level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- EXTREMELY LOW INTERACTION MATCHUP, Yorick just pushes you in post 6 with his infinite ghoul army
    - Sit under tower and farm
- This matchup comes down to sidestepping his E, it's his only ranged tool
    - The hitbox of it grows larger if you try to dodge backwards, but its quite narrow on the sides, so dodge it by side stepping side to side
    - When it's on cooldown you can Q->PTA trade as his ghouls won't auto target you
    - Play at his E max range so if it hits you, you have time to E away before he can cage you
- If he W cages you, your W won't target the cage unless there is absolutely nothing else to hit
    - Don't W and manually auto the cage to get out
- Post 6 it's heavily Yorick favored once he has his maiden, but can look to fight if it dies
- Fortunately Yorick auto pushes the lane with his maidens/ghouls so you can just scale for free
- If he somehow is <60% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Yorick Cage can knockdown and cancel your E.
- You no longer one shot his ghouls
- His Q heals for %missing HP, don't get baited thinking he's low, especially if you have no antiheal

TIPS
- Cull is a strong buy for some sustain in this lane since there's 0 kill potential
- He falls off after lane and you have more value in teamfights. The 1v1 is always difficult if he has maiden though

- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Zac's Q cancels Urgot E at every point (casting or buffering), so you have to stand behind minions/dodge it. If he hits it he can full combo you Q->E->W
- Zac has infinite sustain, so we must use our range to trade
    - Q + PTA if he walks up for CS
    - Don't take mindless trades where he can W/auto, he will out sustain you easily. 
- If he E jumps you look to buffer your E on the shadow, then sidestep the followup Q he will throw at you in a straight line
- If played properly, this is mainly a farming lane. Slow push big waves and try to build a CS lead. Zac is quite hard to kill if he doesn't want to die and they almost always will play passive to scale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited into flashing on him early game, his revive blobs are really hard to kill in time if you've used your E/W already
- Make sure you can insta kill if you flash before he Ults, the knockup and heal buy a lot of time

TIPS
- STEP ON THE BLOBS! 
- Rush executioners, Zac's entire 1v1 capability is based around his absurd healing, level 6+ do not try to all in unless you have antiheal

- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9'
2025-05-04 23:11:11,296 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E5: Details='EARLY GAME
- Get behind Aatrox and look to fight level 1.
    - Try to bait out the Q1 by spacing max range
    - Walk closer and Auto + E in his Q2 animation (Need to be inner edge of Q2)
    - If you FLIP, click away from Q3 and trade autos/PTA

HOW TO TRADE:
- It's all about spacing and playing around his Q. 
- Goal is to trade with Q/Autos/PTA when his Q is on CD. Repeat until hes ~70%, and you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill.

- You cannot flip Aatrox in Q1 + E, it's too long. Look to FLIP on his Q2 + E
    - Aatrox Q1 + Es forward, sidestep side to side 
    - Q2, click away, then click towards him to try to get him to Q2 + E FORWARDS. This is where you try to FLIP him.
    - Make space so he can't Q3 you after FLIPPING

- This lane is really hard if you can't find leads pre-6/first base, as he can slowly poke you down at range with Q1 + E forever. 
- Only look to E if his E is on cooldown


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Q1 damage is hard to avoid, but does minimal damage. Getting hit by Q2 is a lot more damage, so be careful with spacing/buffering E into Q2
- Good Aatrox's will mix up E'ing forwards on Q2, be careful not to get baited. 
- Hard lane as you have to be very knowledgable if your E hits or not. If you miss E/fail E buffer into his Q, you will take too much damage
- Once Aatrox gets Plated Steelcaps, the MS + armor make it extremely hard to trade back
   - Try to fight hard first 3 levels, if he's not behind and TPs back with Steelcaps it's cooked
- Ignite (or anti-heal) is mandatory if you try to kill him. Have to know lethal limits well in this matchup, as he can heal with Passive + Q above 25% if you try to E flash him

- You can "ride" Aatrox W pull by buffering E. Useful in catching them off guard if they're prepping W -> Q under your tower for instance
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver'

- Akali is weak level 1, get behind her and fight
   - If she skills Q, FLIP on her empowered auto. If she skills E, she will not Q as you walk up, so just use your ranged autos to trade and hold E

HOW TO TRADE
- Once Akali gets her W and E, this matchup gets hard as you can't FLIP until she's used both W and E
- Wiggle around her max Q range, if she misses Q, you can look for small Q/leg/PTA trades. 
   - Repeat until she's ~70% HP and you can look for Flash + E + R + Ignite lethal before she can shroud or E away
      - Ignite can tick her down for 25% ult lethal when she's in shroud
- If she hits Q, use your Q slow to space her - you can't trade back if she drops shroud, and taking poke in this lane is bad
- Only look to play small trades around her Q cd/energy levels (if she doesnt get empowered auto off she can only Q twice) until she's in oneshot range. Respect until then and outscale
- Her W and E have long CDs, so if she wastes them look to trade aggressively

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Post 6, Akali can one shot you from ~80% HP, especially if you're pushed up. 
   - You can't reliably E until she's used her E, W, and R, so it's very hard to live. Really focus on not taking bad trades and be respectful (esp if she has Ignite)
- Never E at her directly if she has E up, she can dodge it with her E easily

TIPS
- Buying MR or HP early (negatron/phage) over AD early is better, as you need to be able to tank her abilities before you can E. AD is not as good early on unless as you can't hit her while she's shrouded
- You can buffer your E into her E2 
- Outscale at 9, and hard outscale for the rest of the game. 
   - You get too tanky to oneshot, and you can just leave W on and chunk her everytime she exits shroud to Q/Auto'

- You can look to fight Akshan level 1, but he has to face check you in bush/walk into E range. 
   - If he respects the cheese, don't overforce it. His range and Q slow can kite you out level 1, and he can trade autos with you early.
- He's very strong early, so just focus on farming/Q poke if he doesn't mess up. Your kill windows are at 6 with Ult + Ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Look to Q+Leg/PTA trade after Akshan uses his Q, the slow from it is what sets up his trading patterns. Without it, he's vulnerable
   - Remember to not stand behind minions as it extends his Q range
   - If he hits Q, run away and try to space him with your Q slow to deny his followup Autos. 
- Repeat until you can set up lethal. He's very squishy so you can E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal at 6 from ~80% HP. 
- Hard to E Akshan without Flash, he has high range + E to disengage. Don't force trades and play around his Q CD

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He hits HARD, so be careful about letting him get the Q + double hit passive + PTA trades on you.  
- His invisiblity makes good roams, so make sure to MIA ping when he's gone.
- Akshan is a very snowbally champ, take care to not die early and fall behind. If he has strong item bases, his trades are unplayable, but if he doesn't get a lead he dies whenever your Flash is up

TIPS
- Go Dirk/AD items first base if you have Ignite + Flash up at level 6. If you're flash is down, build Plated Steelcaps. 
- His E can be body blocked to knock him down, try to stand in his E path if you get on top of him.'

- Really try to fight her level 1, as once she gets level 3+ it's hard to ever hit E.
- Get behind her in the bush and try to PREDICT her Q dash when you E. Getting a good trade in level 1 makes this lane a lot more playable
   - Even if you miss E, you can still win the trade with E shield + PTA/legs 

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is difficult with Ambessa because you can't reliably E until she's used all her abilities. Mainly just try to sustain/minimize trading, she has high sustain and no mana costs so she can poke you out hard.
- Ambessa dictates the trades due to her mobility, play around short Q + W/PTA trades when she's in your range
- When she Q1 dashes in -> Q2 dashes out, stand in your wave.
   - Her Q2 does reduced damage if it hits a minion first, and will push the wave back to you as well
   - You can also look to predict E if she gets in range if you are near your tower. Even if you miss, the shield will help the trade
- She has really high CDs, so if she wastes her abilities (especially her shield W), or dashes too close into your E range, look to trade. If she doesn't mess up though, you don't really have windows to fight back unfortunately.
- Really hard to kill Ambessa pre-9. After 9, you can look to take extended trades while she's in between CDs.
- Don't be afraid to E + Flash to kill, really hard to land E on her normally.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Ambessa R will CANCEL your E, never try to buffer E into her R
- Her shielding, passive omnivamp, doran's shield + grasp, and no mana costs makes her a really insane laner. You have to be very careful with your HP/Mana, if you fall behind this lane gets omega hard.

TIPS
- Ambessa's damage is all up front in burst/shielding, and then she has long CDs. If she's still in range, look to fight, especially post-9. 
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind. You do outscale Ambessa if you can hit E, but she scales very very well too.'

- Aurora is not weak early game due to her passive, but you can still fight her. 
- Get behind her and try to push her into the river. She has high range, so if she doesn't int, just use E to gapclose/shield Auto -> E -> Auto -> Auto (PTA), then disengage.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is based around Aurora Q CD. If she has Q up, you have to respect, as it sets up her passive/electrocute trades too well.
   - Try to bait out her Q at max range, then you can look for a Q + PTA/Legs trade.
   - If she has Q up, only look to Q for trading, don't Auto
- Repeat until shes at ~70% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal.
- I like to take Ignite in this lane as playing small, slow trades usually favors Aurora. You have to all-in, and Ignite + early AD items lets you E + Flash at much higher HP levels. 
   - Ignite also helps as if she has a second to R away, Ignite can still tick her down and get you the kill
- Really important in this lane to not let her get free passive procs off, as it gives her sustain. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- When you E + Flash Aurora, make sure you can kill in the E stun. She has a lot of tools to escape/time out your ultimate.
- Aurora E is actually a buffer, good Auroras can buffer your E with her E. Be a little careful of immediately ulting after E + Flash if they can do this.
- Make sure you don't waste Flash, you have no kill potential without Flash and she can just bully you under tower for 5 minutes.
- She can actually dodge your R2 with her R teleport, but it's really hard to time. Not something you have to really play around.

TIPS
- Keep track of her dashes (W and E), as they have long CDs. If she wastes them you can look to take really aggressive trades. '

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is very difficult because Azir bullies you in lane, outranges you, outscales you, and is also hard to gank.
- You cannot play this lane slowly, Azir will always win.  You have to make it volatile and play for a fast E + Flash + Ignite + R oneshot before he pokes you down too much
- Try your best to avoid his Soldier + Q poke trades, and look to Q poke whenever you can. You will usually take more damage, but you can one shot him from much higher HP.
   - If you can find pockets that his soldiers aren't in, you can look to Q + PTA trade. 
- You NEED Flash to kill Azir. Without Flash he will just bully you for 5 minutes under tower, his range is too high for a normal E. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- You have to give CS in this matchup to preserve HP. If you have no way to reset, be very careful tanking his Soldier + Q combo, as if you get too low you can't threaten all in even with summs up.
- You need your jungler to gank you in this matchup, but it's hard to gank Azir as he has his dash + ult to disengage. 
- Be careful of E'ing in too close to his tower, as he can R you into tower aggro

- You can buffer your E into his R, the interaction is a little buggy. If your E connects with Azir as he R's you, you will not be pushed and can flip Azir

   - If you time the E right, you will flip her before she gets her passive up
   - Don't immediately auto again, look to create space so you can get 1-2 more autos for PTA proc in before she can auto you for her Passive shield

HOW TO TRADE
- Camille's W is the main ability to play around, as she cannot get her passive/Qs on you without the slow. 
  - Whenever her W is on CD, we can trade
   - Q her and run at her -> prepare to click backwards to dodge the W -> once her W is gone, look for PTA/Leg trade
      - The slow from Q and MS from Approach Velocity makes it really easy to bait out Camille W this way
- You can buffer E into camille E, so they can't just force E trades on you.
   - Be careful when Camille's are hovering walls, if they're right next to a wall their E can come out surprisingly fast, making it hard to react E to.
- You cannot let her hit W -> Q1/Q2 with Passive shield combo, you will lose too much HP and then she can threaten lethal. 
- If her passive is down and she is not near a wall, you can look to E and trade hard

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Camille's main strength is her gank setup, MAKE SURE TO TRACK ENEMY JUNGLE and not overextend if you don't have vision. 
- Camille R can dodge your E and your R, so usually you need to buffer your E into her E, or E + Flash her to guarantee your E -> R landing.
   - Camille can buffer her her own E -> R, so if she knows you can E her E, be careful of this interaction
- Camille E (hookshot) can buffer your E if it hasn't "attached" to the wall when she's flipped. If you Flip her AFTER it attaches, it will fizzle and she will die. 
- You CANNOT fall behind Camille in lane, or you can never play as she can engage on you from 2 screens out perma

TIPS
- You outscale Camille at 9/Black Cleaver. Generally you win 1v1 vs her all game, but you have to hit E. 
- Your ignite and R go through her passive shield. You can tick her below lethal with Ignite even if she gets the shield.'

- Even if you can't kill her, chunking her is still really good as it sets her up for lethal at level 2 with Ignite + Flash + E

HOW TO TRADE
- Can't play slow trades in this lane, as her Q will eventually poke you out. Play aggressive with your Flash up.
- Even and slightly losing trades are still ok as you can threaten lethal as long as she isn't full HP
- Dodge her Q, then look for Q->PTA small trades to poke her down. If she has Q up, you can Q, but do not go for Autos.
   - If she hits Q, wait out the poison
   - Repeat until she's ~80% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite lethal. 
- Q -> click forwards -> click backwards to try to bait our her Q, they get scared when slowed and you run at them
- Cassio is really squishy at 6 with Ignite, you can oneshot her from really high HP. Just be careful that you don't take too much poke damage. 
- After 6, with enough MS, you can Q -> Run at her -> Buffer E through her R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Do not fight if she lands Q on you
- Be careful of being stunned when near bushes, she can Ult -> W combo you
- Her extended trade is really strong with E spam + Conq, you can't Flip her from full HP, she has to be chunked a little before or she ramps too hard
- Cassio buys a lot of HP (ROA), and even armor sometimes. The matchup gets hard if she hasn't fallen behind and she buys Catalyst first back, as she has too much HP to oneshot now

TIPS
- You can buffer E through her grounding (W) and R, use this to not get caught out. If she can W you, the slow + inability to E will take too much of your HP
- With W on, you can dodge Cassio R by clicking BEHIND YOU. 
   - Visually you'll still face her, but YOU WON'T GET STUNNED
   - Cassio's R stun logic goes off of where your last click was (towards or away from Cass) not your visual model

- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Don't fight level 1 until the minons arrive and crash
- Some Darius's will start W and try to cheese YOU by getting behind you. If he runs from behind you, stand your ground in your wave and Flip him to disengage
- Usually they'll start Q, and try to Q the first 3 creeps, look to space it and get a chunk in. You should always get level 2 Prio as you are ranged.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades in this matchup are based around Darius Q. 
   - Bait it out by wiggling at max range, when it's on CD look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades to chunk him
- Goal is to chunk him to 70%HP before looking for an extended all in. With Ignite and at that HP, he can't get to 5 stacks in time. If you fight 100% to 100% HP, he will have time to 5 stack you and win.
   - But we can only look for these chunks when his Q is on CD
   - Try to freeze lane as much as possible, so we can poke without getting run down
   - When it pushes out, try to slow push. A big minon wave helps if he tries to all in you in the long lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, especially early game, as Darius wants to run you down
- If you miss E, you die
   - Watch out for being in positions where if Darius can just flash your E and then run you down
- If he ever gets a free Q/starts with stacks, don't fight
- Do not Flip forwards aggressively unless Darius is ~70%HP. If he survives at low HP (which he will if >70%HP), he can E->Q with 5 stacks for a gigaheal

TIPS
- You have kill potential on Darius at every stage of the game, but it's Darius favored pre-6. You hard win at 9/Black Cleaver.
- You can buffer his pull (E) with your E, but it's a hard timing to pull off. Try to predict when he'll E you.
   - If you buffer his E you guaranteed win, as he can't get to the outside Q edge.
- In this matchup, missing E is death. Don't hesitate to E flash, as he can easily dodge with flash/ghost. 
- Don't be afraid! You have to stand your ground in this matchup, if you E away defensively you will lose. '

- His passive blocks your E and R2. If he ever walks up into E range, look to E to knock it off (it has long CD)

- Can kill at 6 from 60% with R -> E + Flash if you have Ignite 

- You destroy him in teamfights with R if someone else can pop his passive '

- Really try to get behind and fight Mundo level 1. If you can E -> pop his passive off level 1, it makes the lane significantly easier
- If you chunk him enough, you can easily E + Flash + Ignite one shot at level 2.
   - Usually Mundo's run Ghost TP, so if they don't have Flash it's guaranteed.

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a neutral scaling matchup, it's not that bad for Urgot as long as you stand behind minions to avoid Mundo's Q/E damage
   - You can't really stop his farming with Q, and he can't really stop your farming if you stand behind minions
- You should never be able to E Mundo as he can outrange with Q, so you can't even take his passive
- Everytime Mundo walks up for CS or misses Q, look for a small Q + PTA/Legs trade to chunk him. 
   - Do the same when he's at his tower CS'ing, just poke him down.
   - He has really low health regen in lane, so damage actually sticks to him
- When Mundo is at ~60/70%, to kill:
   - Lead off with R -> E + Flash with the R slow. The E pops off the passive, then you can circle around and execute with R2.
   

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Mundo passive denies your E AND your R2 pull. 
- Your E does not lock-on your W if he has his passive

TIPS
- You outscale at level 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game if not behind. 
   - Most Mundos stack HP and not armor, so your legs + R %HP damage hit HARD in the 1v1 and in teamfights
- If you have Ignite/anti-heal, Mundo's R at rank 1 barely heals. You can execute him with R easily still.
- His passive has a really long CD early, be sure to step on it if you pop it off

- If she Qs a vital, make sure you Q + PTA trade as she runs away. Important you don't miss Q as you can't lock on/trade with her otherwise

- Unless Fiora facechecks you in a brush and you have Ignite, don't fight until after minions arrive. Her vitals heal way too much level 1
- Level 1, try to predict E when she goes to Q your vital. You should be able to secure level 2 prio with your range

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup comes down to forcing out her Parry (W) with damage, before you have to use your E
- If Fiora has W up, only ever use E when:
   - Predicting E when they go to Q a vital
   - E + Flash
       - When doing this, auto -> walk backwards -> then insta E + flash to not make your intentions obvious
   - Intentionally missing E to bait out the parry
- Whenever Fiora Q's, tag her with a Q + PTA trade on the way out.
   - Important to not miss your Q, as then you can't lock on in the wave and she can hard out trade you
- Try to kite the parry/vitals, if she misses Q (or doesn't get the vital MS) this is your window to trade back
- Level 6+, use R to bait out the parry
   - E is more important to land, especially because parrying E will stun you as well.
- Pre-9, it's 50/50, but you have kill potential if you play it well. At level 9 until 2-3 items, you hard win as she eats every leg trying to proc vitals

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful when Q'ing when she wants to Q a vital, she can Q over your Q and then it's hard to trade
- She can parry your E and both casts of your R
- Be mindful of your vitals, if she gets too many free ones with Q + Grasp, you'll be too low to all-in. Important to not fall behind in this lane due to her scaling

TIPS
- Anti-heal is necessary if you don't have Ignite. Bramble is better early for lane, but executioner's scales harder.
- You can reset bad vitals by walking out of range of Fiora
- Position near walls during her R so you can block a vital by hugging a wall.
- After you E + Flash, unless she's super low, don't spam R2 as Fiora's will spam parry as soon as they're unstunned, and may parry your R2 this way
- Fiora outscales you at 3+ items, she just does way too much damage. Important to establish leads before then.
- You can Ctrl + 3 fake Ult emote to try to bait out her parry (best on pj/butcher skins) (https://x.com/quantelol/status/1729204401838158066/video/1)'

- Level 1, definitely look to fight GP:
    - GP's will usually start Barrel (E), and have one prepped in the bush.
    -  If you manage to sneak into the bush and he doesn't see you as minions crash, look for auto + E on GP, then KILL THE BARREL while he's stunned. You can also look to auto the barrel at the start 
    - If he respects the cheese, try to wiggle around the 2nd barrel's chain range to bait it out.  You can E + leg auto to gapclose/shield through the barrel explosion
    - You should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is based around his Barrels (E) and his Q. Always wiggle at 2nd barrel chain range to see if you can bait it out.
   - If he wastes/misses his barrels, look to Flip him, or if not in range for E, a Q + PTA/leg trade is good. 
       - He has an indicator below his HP bar of how many barrels he has left
   - Respect his Q range, especially once he has SHEEN. 
       - Early game his Q only hurts with Grasp up, but after Sheen it is REALLY IMPORTANT you don't let him just perma Q you. 
       - Farm/space with your Q, hide in bushes, don't let him Q you on cooldown. 
       - If he Q's you, try to Q + PTA trade back if there are no barrels around
- GP is really weak without his barrels, if you can pop, dodge, or walk around his barrel radius, you can take heavy trades. 
   - Try to always space far enough out to make him use at least 2 barrels
- When GP is ~60% HP (or if he wastes his Oranges), you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R all in. The ignite is nice as it really cuts his Orange healing. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- HIS ORANGE CAN CLEANSE YOUR R2 EXECUTE. You need to force him to Orange (W) thru damage, before your Ult times out and auto pulls. 
   - This requires high knowledge of your damage. Be sure that if you all-in GP, he's not too high HP and you hold your ultimate for a little so it doesn't time out. 
   - Only press R once! This way it won't auto cast and he can just Orange (W) out. 
- Good GP's will look to Orange (W) your E stun when you E + Flash. Be patient with your R after you E + Flash, because if they orange the E stun they won't be behind you like normal


TIPS
- It's a hard matchup (esp vs Dshield/Grasp GP) until 9 vs good GP, he can just space you perma. After 9/Black Cleaver, and especially at level 13/2 items, you hard beat GP if you hit E. He outscales in teamfights at full build though
- Really really important you don't fall behind after GP gets SHEEN until 9. It's really braindead point and click no counterplay spell, you have to respect and not take too much damage
- At level 9, with no minions around, the matchup gets a lot easier as it's really easy to pop his barrels with W'

- Look to fight Garen really hard early game. If they start E, Auto -> E -> Space their E -> PTA
- If they start W, it's impossible to deal meaningful damage, just look for a PTA proc then drop minion aggro in brush.
- You have complete wave control in this matchup until the wave crashes and bounces back, around level 3

HOW TO TRADE
- If Garen has W up, E'ing into him will always be negative, as even if you win the short trade he will outsustain your HP/mana eventually
- I play this lane by lane-locking garen with my Teleport (with reduced CD from Cosmic Insight), and stacking large item leads on him
    - I don't like to play to fistfight/trade with Garen, as he has infinite resources
    - If we trade hard early game, I'll use my first TP for a Cull buy, else I usually want Phage (1100g) or Pickaxe + Long Sword (1225g)
- Keep your spacing TIGHT. Always keep him at range. If he runs at you with Q, Q him to make space and autos
    - Use your range and autoattacks (no mana cost) in this matchup as much as possible
    - Again, if you try to trade by E'ing at Garen with W, you will just lose out in the long run due to mana costs/lack of sustain
    -  You can look to E the Garen as he Q's at you if he's not as good, sometimes they won't W. Depends on the elo.
- Your Q is only worth the mana to stop his passive from ticking, or to setup a PTA + leg trade. Q alone is not worth the mana for it's damage here
- After flipping Garen, make sure to space a little bit to get out of his E range before following up with Autos
- Always look to stop Garen's passive from ticking, especially if he's lower HP


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Garen cleanses slows with his Q, so make sure you Q him AFTER he Q's when trading
- Keep track of his Phase Rush, it gives slow resists too so if it's active, careful with your R as he'll just run away.
- Garen's love to proxy, especially if they fall behind. Try to keep vision in the river/think to yourself "can he go proxy here?" and stop him from doing so. 
- At 9, make sure you don't turn your W off when he Q (silences you). 
   

TIPS
- You hard outscale Garen at 9/Black Cleaver, you just stat check Garen and lose little DPS when silenced.
- If he has Conqueror + Ignite, you have to be very very respectful level 6+. Taking one trade will put you in lethal range.
   - Conq Garen is USELESS after you hit level 9, and is very weak in teamfights.
   - Phase Rush Garen needs Ignite to kill in lane, but generally has much weaker kill pressure, but scales much harder and can play sidelane later on vs Urgot.

2025-05-04 23:11:11,310 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E47: Details='EARLY GAME
- Really important to fight Gnar level 1 after minions crash. Walk behind him, if he starts Q: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA is 70% of his HP, and sets up a really easy E + Flash + Ignite kill
- If they're good, they'll skill jump (E). BE READY FOR THIS AND HOVER YOUR MOUSE BEHIND YOU to prepare for him double jumping off you
   - If you're fast enough you'll still flip him mid-jump
- If you can Flip/chunk Gnar level 1, it makes your game way easier to play
- Even if you can't Flip him, you hard win by just Eing forwards + legs + PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup doesn't start out too bad, but gets progressively worse as Gnar gets more items. Plated Steelcaps, Phage, Q slow + W MS makes it really hard to touch Mini Gnar, and Mega Gnar does too much damage
   - You really want to force his TP before he gets gold for Plated Steelcaps (1200g) as the lane is UNPLAYABLE afterwards, that's why the level 1 chunk is important
- Play around his Q. If it's up you have to respect his range, but if he uses/misses it, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade.
   - Good movement in this lane to dodge Q, especially Mega Gnar Q, is SUPER important. Hitting one Q -> W passive proc lets him chain run you down for a huge chunk
- When he's in Mega Gnar, you have to be very respectful. Just let it time out and look to re-aggro when he's Mini
   - You CAN Buffer E into his Mega Gnar W/R, which is helpful, but he's so over-statted in Mega you can still lose so be careful
- At 60-70%, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot, just know your damage levels as he can double hop (E) out if you don't kill in the stun.
- When you E or E + Flash Gnar, always click to the side so he can't double hop (E) out after the stun expires


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you haven't gotten a lead by the time gnar gets Plated Steelcaps and/or Phage, just play passively and scale. 
   - It's unrealistic to force trades on Gnar with these items
- Be careful of fighting when he's close to Mega Gnar, he gets a lot of HP/resistances
- Be respectful of his double hop (E) on a minion -> transform -> Mega Gnar R -> W combo, it has super high range and can easily kill/chunk you

TIPS
- Gnar scales pretty well, at 9/Black Cleaver is when the matchup becomes even again, but it's not favored. Gnar's scaling is pretty even to Urgot's, it just depends if you can hit E on him while in Mini Gnar if you win or not
- If he's low rage at the start of teamfights, look to focus him before he can transform.

- Look to get behind Gragas level 1 and fight. Gragas usually starts Body Slam (E), so make sure you are READY to buffer E into his E, you can take 70% of his HP if you do
- Should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Buffering your E into Gragas E is the main way you trade in this lane. Always have your E prepared, as you hard win if you successfully buffer it
- If Gragas doesn't E, you don't really have many options. He will stand back and throw barrels (Q) while healing from his passive, it's very low interaction
   - Good movement to dodge his Q is very important, try not to stand on minions so he has to choose between farming or poking
- It's hard for Gragas to walk up melee range to CS, you can Q + Auto/Leg if he does. They will usually farm with barrels
   - If they use/miss their barrel (Q), look to run at Gragas and take a Q + PTA trade. Again, prepare yourself to potentially buffer his E if he slams at you here
- Repeat until he's ~60-70% HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal. 
   - Make sure you know your damage as his R + E can let him escape really easily if not one shot

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Buffering Gragas E is tricky if he's right on top of you. Try to leave some space in between so you have more time to react.
- A lot of Gragas's will look to knock you into tower with R, but you can buffer Gragas R with E
   - Save your E to try to bait out his ult, it's really easy to outplay
- Gragas W auto is AOE, be careful to not stand too close to his target minion for the splash damage

TIPS
- Gragas is annoying in lane due to his Q + passive healing playstyle, but it's not the worst and you hard outscale him in the 1v1, and in teamfights too. Focus on not taking too much poke and farming up

- It's a little hard to get prio for level 2 because Graves AOE autos, but try to match his autos. If you chunked him level 1, you can one shot with E + Flash + Ignite at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Graves's game plan is to spam push the wave in, and slowly chip you down with auto/Q poke. He has very low 1v1/trading power
- Look to Q + PTA/Leg trade whenever you can. His Q has a long snapback time, so you can fight even if his Q is up, but definitely look to trade if he Q's the wave
- Only look to E him if his dash (E) has been used. He has no reason to use it as he outranges your E with autos, so it's hard to force it out.
   - Also remember that his E stacks give him armor
- Repeat until hes at ~70% HP, then you can kill with E + Flash + Ignite + R, depending on his grit (armor from E) stacks

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his Q bounce angles, especially under tower. That's his main source of poke damage
- If you E + Flash, smokescreen + E + R are effective escape tools, so make sure you have lethal in the stun


TIPS
- Early Dirk/AD items in this lane feel really nice with Ignite. It's hard to play slow poke into graves (he has fleet + lifesteal usually for sustain), so just threatening the all-in E + Flash immediately is effective

HOW TO TRADE
- Look for Q -> PTA/Leg trades when she has 0-1 Q stacks, or if her Q or E are on CD. Don't let her stack Q on minions for free, always look to sneak in Auto/Qs.
- If she has 3-4 stacks, you have to be careful, dodge side to side so Gwen Q->E won't clip you in the center
   - You can look to predict E when she Q->E's forward ONLY if she's below 70%HP. If she's full HP, she'll win the extended trade with a 2nd Q rotation + Conq
- Never E Gwen if she has E up, she can dodge it easily
   - Make sure if you do E, you hit it. Don't be afraid to E + Flash, if you miss E you die
- If Gwen wastes E and she's below 70%HP, you can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all-in.
   - If she has E up, they can react to E + Flash if they're good and it's riskier
- If Gwen wastes W she's also extremely vulnerable and you can look for trades

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Gwen's Shroud (W) makes this matchup quite hard. Gwen can Q->E with Shroud (W) up so you can't hit back, be careful that you don't click into her melee range trying to click on her
- If you E Gwen from outside the shroud, you'll still Flip. HOWEVER:
   - SUPER SECRET MECHANIC: If Gwen stands on the PIXEL EDGE of her Shroud (W), your E will go through her and die. This mechanic makes the matchup SUPER HARD vs Gwen's that know this.
- Her shroud can block your R2 if you go outside of it

TIPS
- A lot of Gwen's damage is backloaded (Q4, R3), and Urgot's R execute + Ignite is a good way of dealing with that if she's chunked out enough at the start
- Gwen's usually don't take Flash, and the champion is really vulnerable to ganks. Calling your jungler if you have E + Flash up is a good way to kill Gwen
- Gwen is pretty strong in lane nowdays, and scales well. If you snowball you destroy her but she will always be useful if she can get to 3+ items

- You can only fight if you have Ignite and he facechecks you, which is unlikely. Just let him push you in

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really low interaction matchup that you can't really look for trades in. Heimer just pushes you in perma, and you get to scale up.
- You can look for small Q poke, but going for Autos is risky as if he grenades (E) you, you lose way too much HP.
- When he grenades (E) you, buffer your E away so you don't tank the charged beam from the towers. 
- Stand behind minions to avoid the rocket (W) poke.
- If Heimer gets low enough or wastes his E, you can one shot with E + Flash + R, but its hard as if he doesn't die within the E stun, you will always die. You can still die even if you kill him as his towers will still hit

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Although it's very unfun, you should be careful of calling your jungler to gank Heimerdinger unless it's obviously free. He has easy 2v1 potential if either of you misplay the gank.
- You can't hit his towers without them hitting you back, your range is too short. 
- He gets lots of MS around his towers, so be careful when Q'ing or E + Flashing
- Be careful of facechecking bushes, he can oneshot you from full HP with some AP

TIPS
- Heimer is a champ that requires lots of kills in lane to be useful later. If you can just farm evenly (or even slightly behind), you'll be 2x his usefulness in teamfights later
- Early negatron/mercs rush is not bad.  You can also play Ignite if you're a Chad and try to kill.

- Stand behind minions and focus on dodging E, if it's up you can't trade hard

- Don't let her poke you down with Q either, they like to Q clear wave -> surprise E

- Definitely want to try to fight Illaoi hard level 1, and pre-6 in general. She becomes impossible to kill post-6 with her R
- Get behind her and look to fight. Try to fight outside of tentacle range, Illaoi W start + tentacles nearby can actually trade with Urgot level 1
- You should get prio. If you don't manage to fight until minions arrive, respect her Q range, or if she isn't Qing be ready to E her W if she W's at you 

HOW TO TRADE
- Illaoi E is the main ability you have to play around. If it's up, especially post-6, you cannot go aggro
   - You can look to trade as hard as you want if she misses it, this is your main window
   - If she hits it, try to exit the tether range ASAP to avoid damage. 
- Always stand behind minions, and try to Q + PTA/Leg trade when she CSes. 
   - You have to be respectful of her Q as well though, have good spacing and don't let her slap you for free
- Illaoi loves to try to hump you under tower, fishing for Es/Qs. This is the only window where you can look to kill Illaoi with E + Flash + R, as she self stuns with her ability animations, and it's easy for her to get tower aggro
- You can kill pre-6 with Ignite, but after 6 it's entirely Illaoi favored

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Illaoi's ult makes her displacement immune, meaning if well timed she can immune your E flip. If the Illaoi is good, you'll almost always have to look for a E + Flash to kill
- Illaois like to Q/W + tentacle the wave to insta kill your minions, opening you up for a surprise E. Be careful for this
- The tentacles still slap, even if you kill them
- Be careful of calling your jungler to gank Illaoi unless its for sure free, she can easily 2v1.
   - Both of you have to dodge the E if you want to gank

TIPS
- If she has no tentacles when she grabs your E, it won't do anything really. You don't have to exit the tether range and can stand your ground and trade back
- Illaoi is a champ that can only lane, unless you have 5 melee champs. She's useless in teamfights so going even and scaling up is a win for Urgot
- The "scaling" in this matchup is dependent on if you dodge Illaoi E or not, she will always be able to kill if she hits it'

- Look hard to fight Irelia level 1. If you can E her before the minions get low and she can't Q away, you smoke her
- If Irelia doesn't appear until the minions are low, be careful of her dodging your E by QQQ'ing the first 3 minions -> Q you with full passive
   - In this scenario, try to predict your E into her Q on the minions
- If Irelia starts E, try to zone her off the first 3 EXP. If she walks up you fist her

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is determined on how many stacks she has/she can get: 
   - When the wave is pushing into you, show respect pre-9, she has max stacks 
   - When the wave is pushing into her, you have to be careful. Try to walk AHEAD of your wave and fight her so she can't dash around thru your wave
   - MAKE SURE YOUR WAVE CRASHES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK IRELIAS FREEZE 1v1
- If she E->Q's you, E behind yourself, not at her, or it will miss
- HOLD YOUR E UNTIL GUARANTEED. They will always try to bait it out with Q dash. 
- If she wastes W, you can look to play aggressive, they usually use it to setup the minion wave to Q through, so be careful  you don't miss E
- You have to stand your ground and fight with Ignite in this matchup, if she can fight you in your minion wave and win you can't play the game


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very patient with your E, always pay attention if she's trying to bait it with a minion to Q to. 
- Her W gives her damage reduction, so don't ult too early if she negates your E damage with W
- She powerspikes hard on BORK and Plated Steelcaps
- If she gets a freeze on you pre-9, hopefully your jungler comes to help, but if not look to roam or put pressure on the map. YOU CAN'T BREAK IT SOLO

TIPS
- This is a very difficult matchup vs good Irelias, and if you make one mistake they can freeze on you forever. 
   - Really focus on playing aggro first 3 waves, and then respecting afterwards if she doesn't fuck up
- You turbo outscale Irelia, especially in teamfights, as long as you get your EXP you're fine.
- Can rush bramble vest + plated steelcaps yourself if you fall behind, your base damage at 9 can stat check her hard

- If you take the brush, Auto -> E -> Space out his E while he's stunned -> Auto Auto PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane pre-9 you always want to play for the freeze. Jax wants the long lane to run you down with max passive stacks
    - Never fight when the wave is pushing into you
    - Jax has a hard time breaking freezes and will eat a lot of damage while being vulnerable to ganks.
    - Very important to look to poke Jax while wave is frozen so when it bounces out you can kill him before he ramps his stacks up
- Very E cooldown-based matchup, whoever E's first loses. Always Buffer your E into his E
    - If you E his E, always click away to not get stunned before Autoing again
- Your Q is also super important, when he jumps on you -> Q under yourself to make space -> Land E
   - Jax's model places him "in" you, so if you E forwards immediately it won't connect
   - Also be careful that he can jump over your Q and then trade
- If he jumps on you with E, buffer it with your E -> Q -> PTA trade and you win. 
   - You can also just E if you can make a tiny bit of space between you guys, usually you have to E backwards/to the side.
- If he jumps on you without using E, Q -> PTA trade, and hold your E
- You can look to all in from 70% HP if you buffer his E, Ignite + R kills him easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Jax's will know you want to Buffer E into his counterstrike (E), and will try to sidestep in their E animation
- When Jax has passive + grasp stacks up, you have to respect. 
- Keep in mind Jax's minions when he walks up with E. They'll try to bait your E, then Q to their minion out of range
- Spacing is super important in this lane, don't let him W + Grasp trade with you for free. 
   - You need an HP advantage pre-9 to trade, or else he can just all in you before you can kill. 
- If he manages to stun you while you flip him, be careful in buffering your R, as he can jump away to dodge it once you're both unstunned

TIPS
- You have kill potential at every point during this lane as long as you're not in the long lane.
- Ignite really helps in this lane as it goes thru his counterstrike (E) 
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver for the rest of the game

- Look to fight Jayce level 1, if you manage to Flip him it makes the lane significantly easier
- Most Jayce's start E or Q, try to push them into the brush and ignite early for vision. 
- If you can Flip/chunk Jayce, level 2 prio -> E + Flash is an easy solokill

HOW TO TRADE
- When facing Jayce:
   - Stay behind minions to dodge his ranged Q
   - Use the brush/respect his auto range to not let him get free autos off
- Just look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades if he enters your range. Use your Q slow to push him off if he's trying to auto you a lot
- If he fucks up his spacing you can even look to Q -> E combo, but be careful of doing this if he's full HP, or you don't have Ult/Ignite. Jayce does a lot of damage if you can't finish him off instantly
- You usually will never have the range to normal E Jayce. Only if he melee Qs into you can you look to E
- Jayce MS gate (ranged E) and knockback (melee E) give him insane self-peel, it's really easy for him to kite you. Missing E/Q can lead to a really bad trade
- With Ignite and early AD items, you one shot Jayce from ~75%HP with E + Flash. Can give CS to avoid taking poke until he's in kill range
   - Because of Jayce's oppressive poke, it's important to look to one-shot before he can slowly poke you down
- When he transforms from Melee -> Ranged, this is a good window to look to all-in as he can't melee E (knockback) for a couple seconds
- You can buffer E into Jayce E, but you have to predict it as it roots you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Jayce's main poke tool is his QE from range, try to walk in random directions when you don't have a minion wave to cover you (like when you're CS'ing under tower)
- Jayce will often look to melee Q your minions, and hit you with the AOE damage. Be respectful of the melee Q radius if you stand too close to your wave
- Jayce has built in mana refund, and sustain with Dblade/biscuits, so his resources are deceptively high

TIPS
- Jayce is a really annoying lane bully, and the better the Jayce the more annoying. I've tried many setups into Jayce like Plated Steepcaps rush + play passive, but I think the best strategy is GIGA AGGRO level 1, and build Dirk/Pickaxe/Long Swords and try to just E + Flash + Ignite instantly. 
   - Cheesing Jayce early is so important, as he has 6 abilities at level 3 and you can no longer trade favorably
   - Playing slow is also just hard vs good Jayces, they can space your Q/E too easily and he has such insane poke
- Playing for level 6 spike (you get an ult, he doesn't) is a good strategy
- You beat Jayce at 9/Black Cleaver and outscale 1v1 and in teamfights the rest of the game'

EARLY GAME
- If Kalista facechecks you in a brush early, you can fight, but generally respect and give her range. Her hop is too OP at kiting level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- It's pretty impossible to trade with Kalista, if she doesn't walk into your E range early game focus on giving cs and PRESERVING HP
- If you can predict Q into her hop, look for a small Q + PTA leg trade
   - This chunk can set her up to be killed at level 2/3 with E + Flash + Ignite
- If she's full HP, just focus on not taking too much poke and hitting Q/Legs when you can, don't overforce trades.
- If you haven't found a lead early game, rush Dirk/AD Items and try to one shot at 6 from ~80%HP with E + Flash + R + Ignite
- Kalista usually perma pushes and is very vulnerable to ganks. If you can't find leads 1v1, just make sure you save Flash for jungle ganks
- Never E at her in front of her, only E + Flash. She's too high range to ever hit a normal E 
    - Very important to not lose Flash as you need it to exist in the lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Care for her Q poke + E resetting on minions to chain slow/auto you poke
- Pay attention to her "hop rythm", if she keeps dashing in one direction look to predict poke with Q where she hops

TIPS
- It's a hard lane, but a very uncommon pick. Only really insane Kalista players can pilot Kalista well enough to make it work.
   - It has to get a lot of kills in lane to be useful later on
   - Kalista top also griefs the enemy draft hard usually
- Kalista gets crippled by CC, so playing around your jungler and trying to make it to teamfights is a very viable strategy

   - Just stand behind your minions to avoid Q damage
- If she wastes her empowered R ability, or her shield, you can look for a small Q + PTA trade to chunk her. 
- Generally, I don't look to interact much in this matchup. Conserve HP, play for a Dirk/Pickaxe first base
   - Then at 6, I look to E + Flash + Ignite + R  oneshot after she uses R+Q to poke
   - You have to wait for her to use R, if she has R + W it heals too much and can prevent your ult from executing
- Once you get some levels and MS going, you can Q- > E combo her. If you hit Flip you hard win

- It is critical you fight Kayle level 1. Get behind her, Flip her, and try to zone her off the first 3 creeps of EXP
- If you chunked her enough level 1, you can look for a dive on the 2nd/3rd wave as you crash into tower.
   - If not, play to setup a freeze/gank angle as the wave then bounces back into you. 
      - Kayle is so weak at this point in the game that you can just walk behind the wave and zone her/fight her 1v1, denying her even more EXP

HOW TO TRADE
- Denying Kayle pre-6 is really important for how trades play out in this lane post-6
- Always look to Q -> E pre-6 Kayle, but focus on not hitting the wave too much. 
   - You want the wave to be pushing into you so you can deny/zone off EXP and setup ganks, which is more important than the trades
   - If you deny enough EXP, you can freeze the wave when you're 6 to her 5, which is huge
- Once Kayle hits 6, it's much harder to hit Q. Still look for Q + PTA/leg trades if you can, but they're rare, especially if she rushes T2 boots
- You can still E + Flash on Kayle post-6 if you have Ignite + AD items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kayle R can block your R2 pull, and in general they will R as you E + Flash to deny burst
   - If you E + Flash, try to see if she insta ults before immediately W'ing + R. If she does, hold off a bit on your burst until it times out.
- Watch out for Kayle's Q thru the minions, and E poke. The damage from these add up
- T2 boots + max passive stacks (gives MS) + W MS make her extremely fast in lane, don't disrespect and miss your E

TIPS
- If you can't find leads in this lane pre-6, don't overforce until level 9. It feels bad, but Kayle will bully you until you get 9/Black Cleaver, so just focus on going even until that spike again
- Kayle outscales you again around 3 items/level 16, so try to close it out early. Her R is a very powerful tool to deny your R

- If he respects your cheese, you can try to trade autos + Legs + PTA by just E'ing forwards to gapclose
- Should get prio for level 2 if played right

HOW TO TRADE
- The main ability to watch out for is his shuriken (Q). Stand behind minions to dodge it, and look for Q + PTA/Leg trades if he gets in range
   - Only look to Q -> Auto if you can't get hit by his Q. If you can, only Q to poke
   - Generally it's hard to look for Q as his Q outranges yours
- Repeat until he's 65%HP, then you can look to E + Flash + R one shot
   - He has really insane escape tools with his W MS and Stun, so make sure you have lethal on the Flip or he will escape fast 
- RUSH MERC TREADS. With merc treads, if he's slowed by Q, you can Q -> E combo usually even if he gets W speed and still Flip. The tenacity helps a lot too, as it lets you buffer E before you get stunned. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his passive stacks on you (3 = stun), if he can Q -> W -> Stun, he can Q you again as you are stunned, which is too much HP to lose
- His empowered auto + W combo hurts, give CS/respect until he uses the empowered auto to CS
- Kennen is a really OP teamfighter. Try to always mark him, or ward flanks/keep track of his flash, Kennen R + Flash can insta win teamfights

- When you trade, it's important you don't dismount him without the ability to kill, or else the next fight he will remount and gain way too much HP to ever fight again
- Look to sidestep his Q, then go for Q -> PTA/Leg trades. 
   - Try to also tether at max Q range, that way even if he hits it you can walk away from it before it yoinks you (the yoink does way more damage)
- If he wastes W on a minion, you can look to trade 
- Only look to Flip Mounted Kled in this matchup if he's chunked ~60% HP, that way you can kill with R + Ignite before he remounts
- Try to R him right before he dismounts, as he gets a smaller hitbox + Q dash and is harder to hit with R
- Your E can "ride" Kled Q for a guaranteed flip (as long as he doesn't E away). 
   - This is useful when Kled looks to mounted Q you while in his dismount animation, you can ride the Q with your E -> R -> kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kled has one of the strongest level 3's in the game, be respectful of his E -> Q -> W combo
- A lot of Kled's will not level their W until they need it to remount, don't get baited
- Be careful when you E + Flash + R when he's almost dismounted, he goes invulnerable as he dismounts, so your R can miss
- Dismounted Kled's Q is actually a buffer, good Kled's can try to counterplay your E with this
- If you R Kled as he remounts, his remount invcan deny your R2
- Kled R gives him really strong roams/ganks on mid lane, make sure to ping his location


TIPS
- Your E can buffer his R for a guaranteed flip
- Kled needs kills in lane to be useful, you OMEGA outscale Kled as the game goes on.
- Kled players rely on knowing when to remount better than you do to get kills. Don't play into this, only dismount when you have E -> R combo up for guaranteed execute'

- After he buys Chain Vest/armor, it's unplayable

- Space his Q range and buffer E into his W if he tries to go aggro

- Respect the walls, you can't E into him if his W or E is up

- PLAY AROUND PHASE RUSH, make sure it's up if he R's you

'
2025-05-04 23:11:11,322 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E89: Details='EARLY GAME
- You can look to fight K'Sante level 1, if they start Q, Auto -> E -> Auto -> Phase Rush out
   - If they start E, they won't Q you as you walk up, so try to predict their E dash with your E
- Generally don't try to overtrade level 1, K'Sante has so much regen with DShield, and you have very low kill potential, the damage won't matter much. Focus on CS'ing 

HOW TO TRADE
- You can only trade with K'Sante pre first base. Once he gets any amount of armor, any trade is negative for you. 
- You can never really go aggressive in this lane, just trying to outscale and be more useful in teamfights
- As he goes for CS, look for small Q + Leg poke. Be respectful of his Q range, and his E -> Q range as well. If Q's a minion, you can look for longer trades
- You can buffer your E into his Q3 knockup
   - Be careful with this, as they can W or E to counter your E buffer if they know about it
- Once he gets his first armor item (Chain Vest) HE IS OMEGA HITLER. He can dash (E) at you in your own wave and still win the trade. 
   - Preemptively click down to dodge his E->Q combo
- You can never E at him if he has W or E up. 
- You can buffer E into K'Sante W (make sure your E hits during the dash, not the channel). The timing on this buffer is a little tricky as he can change how long he holds W
   - This interaction makes it hard for K'Sante to ever ult you/force the all-in, as you can phase rush to safety during the stun
- Just try your best to interact minimally and keep your farm even. K'Sante is one of the few champs that can beat Urgot at 9/Black Cleaver

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always be mindful of your Phase Rush cooldown, if it's down it's really easy for K'Sante to Q -> W -> R chain slow you down, especially with Icebourne Gauntlet
- A good K'Sante can buffer his R into your W, so even if you E buffer his W, he can W -> R and cancel your E 
- If he Q3's you under your tower, you have to E AWAY FROM HIM, or else he can W-> R you over the wall
- He has no mana costs in Ult form, so don't get baited by him appearing OOM
- Watch your positioning near walls when trying to trade/gank K'Sante. Don't give him a R kidnap angle if your jungle ganks

TIPS
- Outscaling K'Sante in the 1v1 is really hard, even at 9/Black Cleaver.  His W is hard for Urgot to dodge, but he's much clunkier in teamfights and falls off hard then compared to Urgot
- His W does not immune him from your R2, it will just delay the pull until his W animation completes'

- Lee Sin looks to perma push/out sustain, hard to trade 

- Don't E if he has W up

- Make sure you dodge his E radius, look to Q + PTA afterwards

- Can E into his Q2, but usually they'll W out trying to bait it
'
2025-05-04 23:11:11,323 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E92: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind him and fight level 1, but only a small Auto -> E -> Auto PTA trade. Don't extend the trade for his Conq + 2nd Q rotation

HOW TO TRADE
- Lee Sin top looks to waveclear/poke with E, and outsustain with W. Doesn't really play for the 1v1
- Everytime he walks up look to Q -> PTA/Leg combo. Can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all in at 6 if hes ~70%HP
   - Again, he has a lot of sustain with W and no mana costs, so don't force it unless he's taken a lot of damage
- Be careful of his E radius, he will spam it on the wave, make sure it doesn't hit you as well
- You cannot E him if he has W up + minions nearby to dash to
- If he ever Q -> Q2s you, you can E into him and chunk him hard. They usually won't do this though unless it's guaranteed lethal
- You can buffer E into Lee Sin kick (R), the timing is a little tricky though. Pay attention on ganks/trades when they make it obvious they want to kick you
   - Especially if they Q onto you while getting ganked, be ready to E backwards if he tries to ward hop -> R behind you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q -> Q2 -> Ward hop mid animation to bait out your E

TIPS
- This pick isn't very common anymore, and it's rather weak. It's hard to win lane as he's very slippery and has high sustain, but you omega outscale him in the 1v1 and in teamfights.
- As long as you don't give him kills in lane, it's a useless pick

- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, but need AP to kill him in teamfights'
2025-05-04 23:11:11,324 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E95: Details='EARLY GAME
- Malphite is really weak level 1, look to get behind him and fight. If he does not facecheck the bush and get into E range, careful to not let him just Q you for free and run away with the MS
- If he has E start, look to Auto -> Flip -> Make space so he can't E -> Auto -> Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- If Malphite ever gets in E range, look to flip, especially if you have legs/equal items
- This is a poke lane, try your best to use TP + Cull + Dblade + Pots to stay health enough to eat farm until 9/Black Cleaver
   - Really important to save your TP to reset for when he pokes you out too hard.
- Malphite will max range Q + Comet you on repeat until you're in lethal. You can't really interact since max range Q + MS lets him kite your E
   - TAKE CONTROL OF THE BRUSHES, don't let him Q you for free. Make him work for it.
   - Early on, E for the shield + Auto + Leg whenever he walks up to Q you
   - You're playing to outsustain his mana pool
- If he has no Q, you can look to Q->PTA/Leg trade, or even Q->E Flip. Careful if you flip pre-9, Malphite in the long lane with armor (Warden's Mail, etc) can run you down and kill you
- Once you break his shield, try to hit him with autos to keep it ticking. Be careful of overusing mana in this lane, as you can't really kill.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Malphite is really hard to kill after his first base for armor. Try to get as much of a lead as you can before then.
- Malphite is really strong level 6+ with an Armor Component, don't ego and just focus on keeping your farm up
- If Malphite rushes Thornmail, it's really hard to win 1v1, even at Black Cleaver. Pray you have AP Carries and play to eat farm + teamfight, not 1v1

TIPS
- Level 1-2, Malphite Q costs a ton of mana and only is worth for him if he has Comet + Manaflowbind up. Stand in front of him and try to baitt him to Q you when those are down 
- If Malphite goes grasp, it's a free win. If they have to actually auto/enter your E range, you can hard win trades
- Don't toggle at level 9+ if he has E attack speed slow on you
- It's hard to kill Malphite, but it's hard for Malphite to kill you, and you outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver. In teamfights, as long as you have some magic damage, you're more useful
- His ult cannot immune Urgot R2, it will execute him after the animation

- Look to get behind Maokai and trade hard, buffer his Q with your E if you can get close enough. 
- Try to deny the first 3 EXP or CS, you should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Maokai is short range, just play around his Smash (Q). 
- Wiggle around his max Q range, it's a bit longer than your auto range. Look for Q->PTA/Leg trade if he misses/uses Q
   - Usually Maokai CS'es with Q, so look for trades everytime he does so. USE YOUR RANGE
- You can look to Q->E combo Maokai and buffer his E through his Q. Make sure close the gap as much as possible before Eing, it makes it easier to buffer E
- If he ever Roots (W) you, E BEHIND YOURSELF to Flip him after he becomes targetable again
- Don't let him get free Grasp + passive autos and free Q poke on you, and he has no tools to fight back. 
   - Deny him CS and outscale


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Maokai W can dodge your E and your R, be careful E'ing Maokai normally. 
   - If his W is up, E + Flash or look to BUFFER E THROUGH HIS Q
   - Also do not R Maokai unless he's E stunned, or wait for him to get out of range so he has no W targets
- Maokai has really nice gank setup, get vision out after you crash waves to not die to jungle
- From 7-9, Maokai (with 4 points Q) with armor items/bami is actually strong, respect until 9

TIPS
- This is a relatively easy tank lane, he has a lot less laning pressure than most tanks but better scaling. 
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, and decisively win 1v1 the rest of the game. However, his teamfight power is better than yours so really look to establish AT LEAST a CS lead in lane
- Try to play side lane vs Maokai later on as he wants to only teamfight

- If you have Ignite, you can look to fight Mordekaiser early. 
- However, Mordekaiser lvl 1 is no joke. You have to get the jump on him Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA, and kite with your legs. 
   - His passive + Conq + 2nd Q cast can make it a close fight
- Usually, just look to E thru the first 3 melees and FLIP Mordekaiser as he Qs them -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage 
   - If you can Flip him here into a chunk, it's huge for your lane
- Should get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- After the first 3 levels, Mordekaiser stat checks you until 9/Black Cleaver
- Your goal is to not contest/play aggro unless he's ~60% HP and in oneshot E + Flash + Ignite + R range. 
   - Look for small Q/Leg poke, but do not E forwards or play too aggro when he's higher HP.
   - His shield + Conq makes him really tanky after your E burst, you usually can't kill and then he ramps up and kills you
- Play around his Q, wiggle around its range and try to bait it out. 
   - If he uses/misses Q, look for a short Q->PTA/leg trade. 
- If he ever wastes shield (W) you can look to heavy trade/all-in if hes ~70%HP
- If he holds shield (W), hold your E in all-ins until hes around ~40% HP so you can burst him below execute 25% range during your E stun. 
   - Even if he shields after, your R will still execute him
- If he ever E's you and you can't dodge it, buffer E away 
   - You can "ride" his scoop (E) with your E, useful in flipping him under tower if he doesn't know

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL IN THE LONG LANE. Mordekaiser can just walk up -> R -> EQ  and force the all in from Full HP. Even if he can't kill you, you will lose way too much HP
- Mordekaiser shield (W) makes him deceptively tanky, be patient with your R after you Flip as he can time it out easily
- Use your Flash to dodge one of his Qs if he all-ins you
- Be careful of him using his Ult to trap you and setup a jungle gank

TIPS
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you, you literally can't fight pre-9 if he's equal pre-9
   - If the wave is pushing away from you, STAND ON YOUR MINIONS and bait him to Q you to push it back
- You can actually complete your R2 as he ults, you can yoink him out of his death realm (R)
- Really difficult lane, but it's Urgot favored at 9/Black Cleaver if you play the fight well. After level 13 and 2 items you hard outscale Mordekaiser for the rest of the game.
   - Mordekaiser is also not a great champ, he's really weak to ranged/kiting. If you fall behind, don't worry if your comp isn't 4+ melees.'

- Look to get behind Nasus and fight level 1, ZONE HIM OFF THE FIRST 3 MELEE EXP. 
- If he walks up past you, try to flip him back towards his tower and PTA chunk for 70% of his HP
- If you chunked hard, look for E + Flash + W + Ignite kill at level 2. If there is no angle, look to freeze/setup a gank after the wave crashes then bounces back
   - As it bounces back, you can walk behind the wave (make sure you don't have minion aggro) and fight/zone off Nasus again
- Trading/deny EXP level 1 is critical in this lane, or else you can't punish Nasus pre-6.  You want to either take his HP and TP, or make him lose EXP.
   - Once he hits 6 the matchup gets really hard in an isolated 1v1 without a lead.

HOW TO TRADE
- Pre-6, if Nasus ever walks up, look to Q->E->Trade as hard as possible. 
- After 6, only look to Flip if hes ~60%HP and you have Ignite/items. His R is an insanely powerful 1v1 tool
   - Just look for Q->Leg/PTA trades until he's low enough to all-in
- Usually Nasus goes 3/4 points E with Dring/Tear, and just stands 10 screens back wave clearing.
   - Not much counterplay to this strat, do your best to dodge the E (impossible challenge)
   - MAKE HIM CHOOSE BETWEEN E'ING YOU OR THE WAVE: Stand on the side of the lane, and look to Q->Trade if he E's the wave
   - Preserve your HP vs this setup: don't overly force the freeze if your jungle isn't nearby
   - His stacks are low with this setup, but he can get CS/EXP. 
- If you haven't found a lead pre-6, play to just farm up until 9/Black Cleaver when you beat Nasus again.
   - Even if you found a lead, you can still easily lose at Nasus 6 + Sheen, focus on growing your CS lead, or chunking him out hard if you want to all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If Nasus runs Phase Rush, respect the cooldown before looking to all-in/R, as it also gives slow resist after
- Nasus R gives him lots of Resists + HP, so don't R too early or it will time out
- His wither (W) slow is really strong at setting up ganks, don't overextend looking too hard to trade

TIPS
- Don't toggle W if you are withered, just leave W on
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver, but eventually in the 1v1 he outscales depending on his stacks.
   - But your teamfight is much better than his due to Urgot's CC, just focus on E/Ring him when your team can focus him down

- If she has clone (W) start, it's a little trickier as she can run out of your auto range. If she starts Dblade, she will usually start clone (W). You can still fight tho, just try to hold your E to bait out her W first
- If you can't trade level 1, focus on using brushes to avoid autos and match her push as best you can

HOW TO TRADE
- Neeko's high range/poke makes this matchup hard, you can only poke with Q
- Do your best to avoid her Q/E/Empowered W Auto
   - If she misses/uses E, you can look for a Q->PTA/Leg trade
   - If she has E up, try to dodge her Q and look for Q poke in return
   - Stand in brushes/respect when has empowered W auto up
- If you can poke her down enough, look for E + Flash + R + Ignite one shot
- I like to go early Dirk/AD items + Ignite in this matchup so I can flash her from high HP. Playing slow lets her poke you down too much, her Q is really hard to dodge
- If you're fast with E + Flash, you will still Flip her even if she clones as you Flip
- If you Flash to kill, make sure you have lethal. Her Clone + E + R can time out/disengage easily, and without Flash you can't play the game for 5 minutes

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful overextending a trade, as her W clone + MS can outrange you easily
- Neeko W can bodyblock your R and E

TIPS
- Count the minions to see if she's invisible, press tab and if her portrait lights up but you don't see her, she's disguised somewhere
- Always remember that if you "see" the enemy jungle on minimap, it could be Neeko. Don't think you're safe from jungle ganks.
- You can buffer E through her E and R

- Level 1 look to fight him before minions spawn, BUT DO NOT FIGHT PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE
   - Auto -> Try to get behind him and E him towards his tower -> Auto -> Phase Rush and disengage
   - If you look for anything more, he can ghost/Q chain slow you and win, as his Ghost lasts longer than Phase Rush
- If you don't fight before minions arrive, look to E Flip him as he CS'es the first 3 and Phase Rush away
- You should always get level 2 prio. Trading hard level 1 sets up a level 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill, which makes this lane A LOT easier

HOW TO TRADE
- You are actually stronger in this matchup pre-6, but once Olaf hits 6 NEVER INTERACT UNTIL 9/Black Cleaver
- Pre-6, look to use your range and Q+Legs to trade hard. 
   - Don't commit your E unless he's low enough to burst in W with Ignite, he gets too much lifesteal + shielding at low HP
   - If he's ~30-40% HP, and you have Ignite + Legs up, you can look to commit to an all-in 
- If Olaf has Ghost/TP, play for prio and call your jungler to gank when the wave bounces back. He has no counterplay to your E + Flash, and then you get his TP on a frozen wave
   - If Olaf has Ghost/Flash, can do the same play, they usually won't react to E + Flash. 
      - Look to kill, or at least chunk and force him to base on a frozen wave with no TP
      - Be a little careful, as if you Flash too early and he's not low enough, he can trade 1 for 1
- If he throws his axe (Q) too far away, look for a Q->Leg trade, he has no all-in threat if he can't pick up his axe
- Post-6, always look to hold the wave and freeze. Be careful when the wave is pushing out. OLAF WANTS THE LONG LANE TO GHOST/Q YOU DOWN IN AN ALL-IN
   - If the wave starts pushing out, stand in your minions and bait him to Q so it pushes back to you
   - Never walk into his Q range unless you have PHASE RUSH up
- Most Olafs will panic R when you R them if they're in execute hp. 
   - Hold your R2, Olafs ult will time out and then you can R2 him in for the execute
- Try to bait him to all in you, then use Phase Rush/E to disengage. He is much weaker without his Ult than you post-9
- You can win at level 9/Black Cleaver vs Olaf if you have Ignite + get the first jump on him, but you will lose if he can instantly melee range/fight you. 
   - Use your range + Phase Rush movement speed to space him

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Olaf R prevents you from E'ing or R executing him, which is why this matchup is hard
- He gets increased lifesteal/shielding when low, you NEED ANTI-HEAL (Ignite or item) to kill at any point in the game
- His ult lasts for as long as he can auto, so try to disengage ASAP to let it time out
- It's often not worth to get your jungler to gank Olaf until 9/Black Cleaver, you don't have any damage/CC thru his R and he can 1v2 easily


TIPS
- You can use Ignite for Nimbus Cloak MS as another disengage tool if your Phase Rush is down
- Olaf R costs 100 mana, so he runs into a lot of mana issues nowdays if he spams axe (Q). If he has <100 mana, can look to E + Flash + R even when he's 6
- You CAN win past 9 if played well, but it's still a 50-50. Unless you're ahead, Olaf's 1v1 is always strong vs Urgot, but his teamfighting is much worse usually.
   - Focus on getting through lane even, then being more useful in 5v5s'

- Look to fight Ornn level 1 with Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA disengage. 
- Ornn doesn't really take a lot of damage, so focus on CSing over trading in this lane after the level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- Interacting with Ornn before 9/Black Cleaver is always negative. We can never flip forwards in this lane, just farm up and outscale
   - His ability to build items in lane means you have to preserve your TP and TAKE RESETS WHEN YOU CAN
   - He only takes damage before he buys, once he has any armor component/bamis he is exodia
- His Q is his main poke ability + sets up larger trades with Q->E. Focus on dodging the Q damage and move away from the pillar immediately
   - Ornn's will usually throw Q to CS, so don't stack on top of your minions
- If Ornn ever looks to Q->E combo you, be ready to buffer E away to deny an extended trade from him
- Ornn breath (W) will deny your Flip, but HE WILL STILL BE STUNNED AFTER. If you E -> Ornn Ws, insta click away while he's stunned so he can't brittle auto you
- If you do have to fight, try to walk behind him as he W's to avoid the Brittle
- If he does waste his Q, W, or E, you can look for Q->PTA/Leg trades before he can W you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always look to stop him from building for free when you can by hitting him. Try to make him choose between building really far away and giving CS/EXP.
   - Some Ornn's will fake build in your face to bait you into Q->E range, or to waste your mana. 
   - Sometimes just standing close to Ornn without hitting/Qing is enough to stop his build
- Ornn's triple brittle combo with Ult legit can oneshot you from 80%HP if you're overextended. Do not disrespect Ornn's damage post-6
- You can buffer E into Ornn's Brittle auto knockback, but the timing is tricky. If you E too early he can knockdown your E with the auto
- If you have Brittle on you, if you're on top of Ornn's Q as it spawns, it will literally push you and consume the Brittle proc for damage


TIPS
- When Ornn summons his R, look to E or E + Flash before he gets it off, if they W they can't recast R2
- Ornn W will not deny your R2, it will execute after his W animation
- After level 9, Most Ornn's will use their E to run away. If you're fast enough, you can Q->E and grab him out of his E since it has an animation delay
- You hard outscale Ornn after 9/Black Cleaver as you can take extended trades now, and you outscale 1v1 for the rest of the game. He does bring equal teamfight value though, so if you can play sidelane it's better

- Prio can go either way in this matchup, just really focus on not taking too many Qs level 1. He can space your E with his Q, so if you don't get the angle don't force it and preserve HP
   - REALLY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T OVERAGGRO LEVEL 1 AND LOSE FREE HP TO PANTH Q, ITS TOO HIGH RANGE/LOW CD TO OUTPLAY

HOW TO TRADE
- You can't really force trades if he has Q, it outranges you. Try to wiggle at his Q range, and if you dodge it look for a Q->PTA/Leg combo.
   - This lane just comes down to respecting his Q poke and range until you outscale.
- You can buffer E into his W, just be on the look out for it as it comes fast
   - Pre-9 however you don't want to E forwards unless hes ~60-70% HP, as he can kill you with Conq + Q + Ignite 
   - Post-9, if you E his W you insta kill him
- Just play slow and look to small trade with Q/Legs while dodging his Qs. If he wastes E, or he's <60%HP you can look to one shot with E + Flash + Ignite + R
- His E CAN Block your R2, and a lot of your E + Flash damage, but usually they will E the wrong way.
   - If they E towards you -> You E Flip them -> you can deal damage as they're E'ing the wrong way now
- If you look to Flip -> all-in with R, only press R once so you can wait for his E to expire

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- RESPECT HIS EMPOWERED Q EXECUTE DAMAGE. It does a lot with Ignite, you never want to be <50%HP in lane vs Panth
- Spam ping if he goes MIA, his R is a strong ganking tool on mid lane
- His Q is actually really hard to dodge front-to-back, it's long. If you have to walk into his Q range, try dodging side to side

TIPS
- Pantheon is strong level 1-5, but falls off around level 6f as you get a combat ult and he doesn't. 
- He gets hard outscaled by level 9/Black Cleaver and is way weaker in 1v1s/teamfiights for the rest of the game.
- His strength is snowballing off his early game, and collecting kills around the map, so focus on not dying/getting poked out and farming'

- As the minions crash, they usually CS the first 3 with Q. Try to E -> PTA -> Disengage
- If she's not giving you E range, use your E for gapclose/shield -> Auto + Leg if she throws her buckler (Passive) auto at you

HOW TO TRADE
- Play slow in this lane, use your range + autos to do work, if she can hit you back with Q+ Passive it's losing
- When she has her buckler (Passive up), stay in bush/give CS until she consumes it. Earlier in the game you can E just to shield the damage -> Auto + Leg
- You can never E Poppy when she has her circle (W) up, but it does have a higher CD than your E
   - Against worse players, you can look to test their reactions on W level 1-3. Sometimes they won't press it, especially if you're a little closer to them
- BE TIGHT WITH YOUR SPACING. Poppy Q is about the same range as your auto, very slightly shorter 
   - When she walks up, Q->Leg/PTA trade, but be sure to use max range auto so she can't Q you
- If she's ~60% HP or wastes W, you can look for E + Flash + R kill. 
   - The best Poppys can W your E + Flash, so be respectful depending on your Elo
- If you can kill, lead with R -> They will channel R -> Buffer Poppy R with your E -> Kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Poppys will use their E on minions as a gapcloser/escape
   - Be careful of Poppy E'ing a minion -> right on top of you for Q -> you can't E because she has W
   - Also be careful of E + Flashing when she has a minion to E to for escape
- Always pay attention to how close you are to walls for her E, she does too much damage if she gets the stun off. 
   - The upper walls of top lane are closer than they seem
- Without flash up, you can't live a gank vs Poppy + Jungler as you can't E away and she can perma slow you

TIPS
- You can buffer Poppy E and R with your E. Both are tricky timings, especially the E
   - You need fast reactions for Poppy E bufer. Whenever you walk near a wall, just hover your E button. You will still get stunned, but you'll also Flip + Stun Poppy
   - Poppy R is a little easier, give some space so you can react
- YOU CAN FLIP (E) POPPY WITH HER CIRCLE (W) ON, IF YOU ARE ON TOP OF HER MODEL. 
   - If you are that close, it will insta flip, so it's not considered a dash, but you have to be RIGHT ON HER MODEL.
   - If she E+W,  you can buffer E into her E and W won't knock you down as you are close enough
- Recasting R2 will cancel knockbacks, so if Poppy has R'ed you while you R2 execute someone, it will put you back on the ground 
- Poppy always has relevancy due to her W, but you hard outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver'

- Level 1, try to get behind Quinn and E her. 
- They usually don't get in E range, so try to predict buffer E into her E. 
   - They usually Auto -> E, so try to time it after the first Auto
   - If you buffer successfully she literally just dies level 1
- If you can't, just try to take brush and match her push. Don't take too many free autos.

HOW TO TRADE
- Quinn is really weak to Urgot E as it puts her behind Urgot, so she can't E away like normal
- Stand behind minions to dodge her blind (Q) and Q poke until shes 75% HP, then look for E + Flash + R + Ignite oneshot
   - Only go for auto attacks if her Q/E is down
- Buffering E into Quinn E is always a guaranteed kill, but a really hard timing to get down as Quinn E comes out FAST.
   - They usually E after an empowered auto, so look to E around that timing
- If she's even slightly chunked (2-3 Qs), you can one shot at 6 with Ignite + Dirk/AD Components. Don't be afraid to just E + Flash
- It's important you don't waste your E, as she can take all your HP running you down with her MS + Passive autos

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q'ing against good Quinns, they can E OVER it and dodge it.
   - For some real mindgames, if they do this, you can buffer E as soon as you Q, that way if they E to dodge your Q you Flip them
- Her level 6 is really annoying for just roaming, make sure to spam your mid/jungle to be careful
- Keep her W vision reveal in mind when trying to cheese, I like to stand in the Alcove or really far back so she can't spot me

TIPS
- If you E + Flash Quinn, make sure to keep kiting towards her tower so she can't E to safety
- If you get a lead on Quinn, it's really hard for her to play 1v1, and you one shot her with E the entire game. She will just try to roam around the map, so make sure you punish if she does'

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is weird, you can only look to trade when his W isn't on. 
- If he has W on, only auto attack him if you have a leg up
- Look to trade and bait ous his W. Wait for his W to expire before dumping Q + PTA + W on him. 
   - If he takes enough damage with W down, you can kill with R
- Just use your range + autos whenever you can, try not to commit too much mana as he's hard to kill
- It's actually not that bad of a matchup because he has no kill pressure, just annoying. Just farm up and scale
- If you can flip him in front of tower with W on, you can kill him as he will get aggro

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- MAKE SURE YOU TURN W OFF BEFORE HE TAUNTS (E) YOU. You will insta die as each of your W ticks make you take full damage from his W + Thornmail
- His R is a pretty fast dash, so be patient with your R or wait for your E stun
- They usually look for the proxy, try to ward the river so you can see if he tries to. If you have an AP Jungler you can easily kill him.

TIPS
- Rammus is an easy lane, but even if he's 0-10 he will be UNKILLABLE if you don't have consistent AP damage (Azir good, Nidalee bad)
   - I would dodge if we were 3-4+ AD champs
- You never can really kill Rammus after he gets Thornmail, he just gets too much armor. Play to E/R him in teamfights where your AP champs can hit him'

- If Rek'Sai tries to knock you up (W) first, you can buffer E and flip her. Be prepared for this if she tunnels (E) at you
- Realistically save E for E + Flash when she's around 50% HP.
   - She has to be lower than usual because she can time out your R with her R animation
- Her main tool is her SUSTAIN. Keep your spacing tight and don't enter her melee Q range, and you should always win

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

- She can set up ganks really well with her tunnels, so respect jungle

HOW TO TRADE
- Renekton's has good short trades, good long trades (Conq + R), and high sustain (Q). He is a lane bully, so our primary goal should be to go even until 9/Black Cleaver
- Pay attention to his fury. If he has low fury, you can play aggressive with Q + PTA/Leg trades when he steps up. If he has high fury you have to respect
- Be tight with your spacing, try to get Q/Auto poke while avoiding his Q
- Buffering E into Renekton stun (W) is a good window to trade, they look to E->W (buffer E before they can E out)
   - HOWEVER, don't E forwards in the long lane if he's level 6 and now <60%HP, as his Ult + Conq can run you down
- Good Renketons will mix up his trading pattern, E-> Q -> E is hard to react to, just try to space his initial E

HOW TO TRADE
- Rengar's W makes every trade winning for him before you have antiheal, game plan is to keep bushes warded and stand on the far side so he can't jump you
- AVOID FIGHTING NEAR BUSHES. Look to just play slow and scale up, if he gives you angles to poke take them and you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot if hes <60% HP.

- RUSH ANTIHEAL. Once you get antiheal you can take more aggressive trades, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade after he jumps to CS a minion. 
   - You can even try to predict E as he jumps

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rengar Empowered W can cleanse your Flip, stun, AND R2. Make sure to keep track of his ferocity when R/E'ing
- If you ward the brush and rengar sees it, he can insta oneshot it with Q. Make sure when you ward the brush he doesn't see it
- Spam ping when he goes MIA, his Ult is great at ganking your jungle/mid
- Leaping from brush at 0 ferocity gives him a stack, so be careful of his empowered cast in one spell rotation from brush

- Ideally wait for minions to crash, then look to E flip + PTA while they Q to CS the first 3, then kite back to your own minion wave
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- SPACING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, always keep Riven at max range and use your Q + Autos + Legs to poke her down
   - If she Q's forwards, look for a Q -> PTA/Leg trade to deter her from coming closer with Q
   - Make her have to use E + Q1 to gapclose if she wants to trade, if she can Q early for damage it's hard
- This lane is based around her shield (E) CD. If it's up you have to respect and can't commit your E
- Look to Flip (E) on her stun (W) or Q3.
   - Q3 is riskier to E at, as it's higher range, and she can E away before your E connects, Don't recommend E'ing Riven's Q3 unless they're noobs
   - Better Rivens will look to E forwards -> W -> Auto -> Q out. Be prepared to flip during E->W, you will kill if you do this, but the timing is hard
- Repeat trades until shes 60-70%HP. If she wastes her E, you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R kill
- A good Riven will be hard to kill, so just focus on applying pressure with your auto + Q range. Build a CS lead and outscale.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL TO NOT LET HER BAIT YOUR E, IF YOU MISS E YOU DIE. 
- Riven is one of the best proxy champs, don't let her as she can easily kill your Jungler. Try to put vision in river and watch her if she tries to go around
- Do not underestimate Conq + Ignite + Level 6 Riven, she can kill you from 80%HP

TIPS
- This matchup is generally good for Urgot as he wins early + outscales, but Riven can definitely outplay at 6 with Ignite.  
   - If you fight anywhere not near your tower, be careful that she can just flash your E if you all-in (even from full HP)
- The longer the game goes the harder you outscale.  Hitting E on Riven in teamfights = instakill.
- CC absolutely fucks Riven, if you can pair Urgot with any CC jungler (Vi, Taliyah, etc) she cannot play'

- You can look to trade with Rumble level 1 if you get behind him, they usually start E
- If he respects the cheese and doesn't check the bush, don't try to overforce. The E slow + damage is too hard to outplay
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- It's really hard to trade with Rumble after level 2-3, since his flamethrower (Q), W MS, and E slow let him space you easily. Give CS and preserve your HP.
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you. If he tries to Q you, stand your ground in your wave with Q + PTA/Legs. 
   - If you fight back, Rumble will click away meaning his Q won't be hitting you for a little
- Try your hardest to not fall behind. If you can't stand your ground in your wave, he can run behind your wave and Q->E you without consequences
- It's hard to play slow in this matchup, as he will just poke you down. Try to trade hard early game, then look to E + Flash + W + Ignite at level 2-3 for a kill
   - Even if you chunk + trade flashes, it's still fine
- If he ever wastes W, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade, or even an all-in if he's low enough
- At level 6, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill if hes ~70%HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he's near OVERHEAT, if you look to E + Flash and don't kill him in the Stun, his overheat autos HURT
- Dodge his E's, if he can hit both on you they shred a lot of MR and you get oneshot
- Rumble Q and E DO NOT DRAW MINION AGGRO, so don't feel too safe in a big wave.

TIPS
- It's quite hard to dodge Rumble E due to your large hitbox, standing behind minions is your best bet 
- If you Flip Rumble in Q, his Q will not face you, you can reduce some damage in the all-in this way
- If you fall behind/struggle, sitting on a Negatron Cloak isn't bad
- You outscale Rumble at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind, and demolish him as the game goes on in 1v1/teamfights. Going down 20CS in this lane is fine, just focus on getting EXP and not dying'

- Level 1 look to get behind him and fight. Usually he will start W, so if he doesn't enter E range, just Auto -> E to Gapclose/shield -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Play for level 2 prio, should get it
- If he's chunked enough, look to E + Flash + W level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Ryze outranges you and has strong poke, as well as strong disengage with W + Phase Rush
- Stand behind minions and look for Q poke. 
   - If he has no angle to bounce/hit Q on you, can extend Q->PTA/Leg trade
- If he gives range, Look to Q->E gapclose 
   - When you get near with Q slow + Approach Velocity MS, most Ryze's will try to root
   - BUFFER E THROUGH RYZE ROOT to hard win the trade. It's the same range as your E so if you E as soon as you're in range to flip, it will go thru usually
- Repeat until he's ~60%HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal
- Lane is tricky, especially because Ryze goes HP in Catalyst/ROA so he's hard to oneshot
- Don't overforce, if you take too much poke it's hard to play the all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Respect his ability to kite you with Phase Rush, W slow, and range.
- Be careful of standing too close to minions, Ryze can E->Q chain off the minions to hit you
- If you look to E + Flash + R, be aware that you only have 2s to kill with R, as he will Ult out himself

TIPS
- Merc Treads rush helps a ton in landing E. 
- Ryze scales really well, harder than Urgot, but post 9 (and especially if you get movement speed items like Youmuu's) you one shot him 1v1. 
- As long as you can get on top of Ryze and Flip, you win.'

- If she starts Q, she can knockdown your E. Look to trade Autos 
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Play around her W, it's her main damage ability. If she uses it, kite side to side to dodge it
   - When it's on cooldown look for Q->PTA/Leg trade
- You can Buffer her Dash (Q) with E, they usually don't Q in but be ready to Flip if she does
- Be ready to buffer E away from her R or stun (E). She has really low kill threat in lane but sets up ganks extremely well
- Maintain your spacing, and play to punish her on every CS with Q/Autos. As long as you don't eat too many Ws, she can't do much and you outscale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E at her first, she can knock it down with Q.
- Her burst damage with R + Ignite + her full combo does a lot of damage, don't disrespect if you're ~60%HP

TIPS
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game 1v1. She has good utility in teamfights, but yours is better. Try to play sidelane as you are much stronger there

2025-05-04 23:11:11,337 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E149: Details='EARLY GAME
- Be careful in fighting Sett level 1, he's strong with W + Conq. 
- As the minions crash, auto him once. If you see his Grit stack, disengage (he has W) and just play for push, small chip autos.
- If it doesn't, he has E and you can look to Auto -> Flip -> Auto Auto PTA. 
   - Try to buffer E through his E
- You should always get level 2 prio as long as you don't give him a big W charge

HOW TO TRADE
- Don't let him stack W. Look for small Q + PTA trades, then insta disengage before he can E->W you.
   - If he Ws, you will have enough range to dodge the center by moving side to side
- Sett has long CDs, but it's hard to make him use them unfavorably. Just farming and outscaling in this matchup is good
   - Of course if he does waste his W, you can look to take a big trade. 
- Never E forwards aggressively until 9/Black Cleaver unless he's chunked. He has really good extended trades with Conq + W
- If he tries to Q for MS -> E you to force trades, be ready to buffer E away. If you can do this, he can't ever force trades on you. 
- If hes ~40-50% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R one shot before he can W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He has really high sustain when he gets low, if you don't have Ignite, don't overforce trying to kill him without E unless you have R to execute
- Sett R cancels your E completely, so be careful E'ing around him.
- Also be careful when E'ing forwards in lane, as he can ult you back into his tower/side of the map to extend the trade

TIPS
- You can actually flip Sett as he W's behind you, so that his W completely misses. However this is risky as the timing has to be clean, and if he combos E->W it could mess it up
- You are stronger at 9/Black Cleaver, but nothing too crazy. As the game goes on you destroy him, especially if you can bait out/dodge the W, he has nothing
- In teamfights just make sure you don't give Sett an angle to R you into your backline
   - If you E->R Sett in fights with followup, often you can 1shot him so fast they can't even press W

- Look to just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA as he tries to CS the first 3 creeps
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is all about spacing and playing your range + autos. Shen should never be able to walk up and Q + Grasp auto you
   - His Q does give him 50 more AA range
- You can buffer E into his taunt (E). Early game if they are aggro they might taunt you, be ready to buffer E 
   - If he's close to you, buffer E backwards.
   - If he's farther away, you can buffer E at him
- Don't lead with E in trades, as he can W or E away himself.
- If you flip him, hold W for after his W. They usually will drop their zone (W) immediately
- Shen's laning power is really low. It's important you focus on wave management. 
   - You always want to SLOW PUSH, to be able to crash a big wave and deny Shen EXP/CS if he Ults away at 6
      - You can also freeze, but pushing is way better
- SPAM PING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF SHEN ULT WHEN HE HITS 6, THE ONLY THING SHEN CAN DO IS MAKE YOUR TEAM LOSE (Which is pretty big)

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Shen's Q does more damage if he drags it through your body (it also slows you if you are running away)
- Shen can nullify you in teamfights quite hard with his Ult + W + Taunt to deny your E and R

TIPS
- I like Demolish in this matchup as you can take a plate or 2 every time he Ults away
- Once you hit 9, if Shen just sits under his tower, look to proxy waves and create tempo on the map so he can't R away easily

   - Be careful if Singed Qs the wave, if you miss E/get kited, he can hit level 2 fast

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is super easy. You outrange and bully Singed, ouscale him, and can even deny his Flip (E) with your own E buffer
- Watch out for 3 things:
   1) Singed E + Flash into his W ground under his tower
        - If you are careful with your autos/read his body language for when he wants to Flash, this is easily outplayable
   2) Singed getting to Proxy
        - NEVER GRIEF YOUR TEMPO, WARD THE RIVER/WRAP AROUND ENTRANCES, AND KEEP PUSHING HIM IN OR FREEZING
        - Conciously think about how Singed could potentially proxy you and look to stop it. 
        - Singed can only play the game if he can proxy, so you want to deny him the proxy AT ALL COSTS
   3) Jungle ganks
        - He has really good gank setup, so try to get deep vision out before you push Singed in
- If you don't blunder those 3 things, Singed can literally not play. Use your Range and punish/deny him off every CS With Q + PTA/Leg trades
- You can buffer his E by E'ing backwards.Uno Reverse you flip him instead
- You can buffer E while his W goo is midair, so he can't ground you from Eing

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Read the above section
- Conq Ignite Singed can be quite scary at level 6. 

TIPS
- Singed will usually have to give up EXP/CS and roam a lot in this matchup. Give your mid/bot lots of MIA pings
- If Singed is in the proxy position, it's worth giving a wave to push him out if your jungle is on your side. If you can't, look to proxy yourself if you're level 9
- You hard outscale Singed, but he provides lots of utility in teamfights even if really behind. Look to sidelane a lot, he can't really stop you from just taking the towers'

- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Like most tank lanes, this matchup is not bad until Sion gets his first armor item on base (esp Steelcaps or Wardens mail)
- Sion can space and take small trades vs Urgot really easily with his E/Q knockup/W shield
   - It's hard for Urgot to outplay. We just look to not interact and outscale
- If he wastes Q or W, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade
- Unless Sion is chunked or really behind, don't E forwards unless near your tower. He's so tanky you're never killing, and he can win the extended trade with his 2nd Q rotation
- The only interaction is trying to buffer Sion Q with E, but it's really hard as Sion can release Q at any point
   - This buffer interaction takes a lot of experience to know when to "time" your E
   - You can try to time it on the max charged Sion Q (it's always the same time), but that's risky since it will do a lot of damage + Stun you for a longer time. Generally not worth to go for
   - The closer you are to Sion the easier it is to buffer E, max range Es into his Q are much easier for him to knockdown. 
- Approach Velocity is clutch in this matchup as you can gapclose Q->E fast enough before he can charge his Q enough

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Pay attention to your minions, Sion will try to E them thru you to slow so he can trade with his Q
- Sion R can immune your R2. Generally no way around this since his ult lasts way longer than yours does, you can't just time it out

TIPS
- Try to break his shield (W) before he can activate it, then it does no damage
- You can buffer E into sion R
- You hard outscale Sion with your %HP Legs and Ult. Just make sure you don't fall behind in lane and in teamfights, he's really easy to E->R '

- If he ever E2's you, just buffer E into it and he gets 1shot with Ignite
- Don't E if he has E up. Just use your range, Q + Auto + PTA + Legs demolish Sylas, he's really squishy
- Sometimes Sylas will gapclose with W (it's a short dash), if you're ready you can snag them with E on this. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If he is putting points in Q, make sure you are dodging them. The delayed Q explosion does more damage, so don't get hit by that

- Make sure to dodge Q by moving side to side after you E. If he hits Q it heals him, and this trade isn't that good
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Stand behind minions so he can't Q you and TK can't interact with you. 
- Maintain your spacing! If he can't stack his passive on you with free Autos, you get to free scale
- If he goes for CS, look for Q->PTA/Leg trades as long as you can stand behind a minion to not get hit by his Q
- If TK jumps at you (W), BUFFER YOUR E AT HIS SHADOW ON THE GROUND. You can look to Auto, then dodge side to side for his Q as he becomes unstunned
- Post level 9, you can take extended trades with him hard, just make sure you don't get kidnapped under tower
- Watch his grey health -> shield when looking to all-in with R. 
   - Try to save your E for when hes ~40% so that even if he shields after, he'll be under the 25% R Execute range still


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- TK's only real kill angle is to Q->R kidnap you under tower.
   - If TK does land Q on you, be very careful. The slow will let him auto you -> Eat (R) you.
- Always be careful under his tower so he doesn't kidnap you. It's not worth harassing him under tower, just crash the wave and back up unless he's low.

TIPS
- You demolish TK 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game in the 1v1. 
- TK is generally useless in teamfights compared to you unless giga fed. If you can E->R him with followup, he will usually die before he can shield or W away
- You can recast R2 from inside TK, even if he's eaten you. It is a funny interaction

- Teemo has really high auto range, so it's unlikely you can Flip level 1.
- As the minions crash, take the bush. When he autos, E for shield -> Auto -> Disengage
   - If Teemo starts blind (Q), his AA dmg is weak and it's hard for him to push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke teemo out with Q until hes ~70% HP, then you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot
- If Teemo uses/wastes his blind (Q), you can look to take a heavier Q->PTA trade
   - If he has blind (Q) up, don't look to over trade
- If Teemo moves to close to you, you can look to Q->E if he's under 60-70% HP. Be careful Flipping if he's full HP, since his blind + Ignite can win an all-in before 6
- Teemo will always die if you hit Flip (E), but he's very fast with a small hitbox. Be patient, slowly Q poke him down, then E + Flash, or look to Q->E->R
   - If he wastes his blind (Q) for random poke don't be afraid to E flash all in
- Your Q is really important, use it to space/push Teemo back if he tries to trade. If you miss it Teemo can look to sprint at you and AA you down. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E + Flash + R all-in when Teemo has blind (Q) up, make sure you know your lethal limits, since he can time half your ult out with Q
- Try to keep a ward in the bush closest to your tower, so you can see if he goes invisible there to cheese after the wave crashes into your tower

TIPS
- If you ever E him and he blinds you before he gets stunned, hold your W until you are unblinded
- Teemo has high auto range, so TAKE THE BUSH. 
- Rushing merc treads is strong, the extra movement speed helps with combing Q->E and tenacity reduces the blind duration
- Swap to Red trinket at 9 to clear shrooms
- Annoying champ in lane, but falls off hard. You are much stronger in sidelane/teamfights if not behind!

- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range
   - Save E > R combo for when he's ~60-70% HP. 
       - Ult won't time out
       - If you insta E, they may insta R, making the 1v1 hard
       - If they hold R, you can 1shot him in the E flip depending on your items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Trundle can cancel your E with his pillar (E) if timed well. 
- Trundle's level 6 is extremely strong 1v1, be very respectful especially if he has ghost + the long lane


TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well
   - If you have enough damage, Trundle gets one shot in your E flip before he can Ult/ramp up'

- Don't fight Tryndamere until minions arrive
- Always start in lane: Don't let Trynda get free fury stacks
- Instantly look to take bush/auto him as he walks up. Don't let him stack fury for free
   - Hold your E, just use your autos. If he spins on you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - If he doesn't spin, push him off CS with your legs/range and get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- You can play really aggressive in this matchup with PTA + Ignite pre-6, but after 6 you have to play a lot more respectful. 
-  His R/sustain counter you from lvl 6-9 just let the wave push into you and farm. They usually hit it a lot to stack fury
- If the wave is pushing out, slow push and build big waves. Stand in front of your minions and try to auto, so he can't stack fury, and hope the wave crashes
- Trade based around his fury:
   - If he has low fury, look to be aggressive and use your Range + Legs to push him off so he can't auto for fury
   - If he has high fury, you have to respect AND HOLD YOUR Q. If he spins on you, use your Q to slow and make space. You don't want to E here or he can run you down/dive you
- Never E forwards if he has ult, high fury, or full HP. Also keep in mind he can E to dodge your E
- HOW TO PLAY THE ALL-IN/DIVE:
   - We want to use the FULL 4s of our R slow + R pull animation to time out his ult
   - Make sure you R him at ~200HP. If R base damage can "kill" Trynda (even if he's in R) it will AUTO PULL. THAT IS BAD.
   - As he dives,  once he's lower: R -> E/Auto to force his R -> Run and let R2 auto time out after 4s -> Pull him in + Ignite -> Hope his R is over
       - Usually Tryndamere will have ~0.5-1s of Ult left, so hit him with an auto and Ignite 
       - MAKE SURE YOU IGNITE AT THE END OF THE FIGHT SO ITS NOT WASTED IN HIS R


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, they will always look to run you down with W slow + Ghost + Lethal Tempo
- Tryndamere has INFINITE SUSTAIN and is hard to all-in because of R. Don't overtrade/OOM yourself with Q/E, just use your Range + Autos
- Tryndamere W is "castable" without needing vision of you. He can tell if you're cheesing in a bush

TIPS
- Try to get Plated Steelcaps first base
- After 9/Black Cleaver you hard outscale for the rest of the game
   - You hard outscale Tryndamere because later on, you do so much damage you force his R in your E flip alone
   - Then you can kite him out easily. You won't kill, but Tryndamere without R IS NOT A CHAMP.'

- If he doesn't facecheck you, it's hard to E due to TF's range. Look to E to gapclose -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- He's really squishy, so if you can trade level 1 he gets oneshot at level 2 with E + F + Ignite + W
- Hard to get prio due to his range, take the bushes and try to match his push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke TF out with Q+Leg Autos until we can E + Flash + R + Ignite at 70%HP
- If he has his card up (W), don't auto, just Q. If he's used it then you can go for a Q -> PTA trade
- Always try to take control of the bush so he can't auto you for free
- Early game his range and damage are quite oppressive, you don't need to force trades. 
    - Level 6 this matchup gets much easier because of your R
- You can buffer E through his gold card, but it still outranges so you won't Flip
   - UNLESS you have a lot of MS, then you can Q->E, but make sure to get really close after Qing and buffer E just as the gold card hits


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-  His damage comes from his E proc, pay attention to when it's up
- Be careful of the Red Card splash damage around minions
- TF has INSANE ROAMS/GANKS with Ghost, his Ult, and Gold card. Really make sure to ping your team so they respect his ganking power

TIPS
- TF is a very summ (ghost/flash) reliant champ, look to punish when they are down (esp if you have Flash up)
- No one really plays AD TF top anymore, but his scaling is still strong if he doesn't fall behind. As long as you hit E + Flash he insta dies though

- Can't really interact, just let him push you in and farm up. You hard outscale

- Save Phase Rush for when he tries to E stun -> Empowered R you
- It's honestly not worth the mana to Q for damage, you can't really kill until 9/Black Cleaver and he has SO MUCH SUSTAIN

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

- His empowered W gives him a lot of health + big shield, be careful to not get baited

- Set him up for a lvl 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill
- Take bush and try your best to match his push, his range gives him level 2 prio usually

HOW TO TRADE
- Really difficult matchup, Varus's base damage is so high he kind of stat checks you at all points
- If he has Bone Plating, PTA, Barrier it's really difficult as he can fight you early with this setup. Try to get behind him and if you can hit E with Ignite you can still win.
- If he has no barrier, you can 1-shot him with E flash at all points.
- Just look for Q poke when you can and avoid getting into his Auto range
- Rush Dirk for the dirk level 6 Ignite powerspike, so you can oneshot from 80/90% HP.
- If  he messes up spacing and you can gapclose with Q->E, look for that. If he doesn't, really important you don't waste Flash as you need it to one shot. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-If you can't manage to get leads on him early, it's really important you respect his level up timers/range. He deals a ton of damage from a long range, and if you take one bad trade it's hard to overcome that HP difference in an all-in. 

TIPS
- You can buffer your E away if he tries to R you
- You don't outscale Varus, but you can always one shot him if you go damage build. Try to establish a kill or take his flash early so he's vulnerable to ganks/E flash, and if you can't just play conservatively until a window opens up.

HOW TO TRADE
- Goal is to poke her to 75% with Q, then look for E + Flash + R oneshot
- When Vayne Qs forward, look to trade with Q+PTA
- If you Q first, Vayne can tumble over your Q and take a good trade
- Save your E + Flash for AFTER she tumbles, or she can dodge it
- If you ever hit E, vayne dies, but you can usually only hit with Flash. If you have enough MS, you can Q->E if she tumbles forward.

HOW TO TRADE
- Wincons in this lane:
    - Constant pressure on Vlad with Q -> leg + auto, especially when his Q is on CD (you can see it's CD from his resource bar), to not let him slowly outsustain you with his healing
    - Not letting him empowered Q you
    - Killing with E flash before he can pool
- If you let Vlad play the slow game and push you in/slowly chip at your HP with Q you will be pushed out of lane and outscaled
- Early on try to test how good his reactions are by Eing at him.
    - Pretend you are disengaging and walk backwards after a Q auto trade, he will walk forwards as you walk back, then E him
    - Against competent Vladimirs though, you will only ever be able to E him before he pools with E + Flash (if the Vladimir is good enough to pool this its gg for you)
- At 70%, look for E + Flash + Ignite + R.
    - Even if he is able to cast pool after your E stun wears off, Ignite will tick him down and you can execute when he resurfaces from W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful not to R2 during his pool animation, as it can block R2

TIPS
- Vladimir likes to run straight at you when he gets his empowered Q ms, this is an easy timing to Q poke him

- His Q can unstoppable your E so be careful

- Don't get baited if he has Barrier + E up

- Level 1 most Warwicks will try to walk up and Q you. Auto -> E -> Auto and they will be half HP and forced to concede prio.

HOW TO TRADE
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in Autos/Legs without letting him Q
- Your autos barely outrange his Q, so spacing is very important as if he trade autos/Q you lose out eventually
- USE YOUR RANGE, PUSH HIM IN, POKE HIM, BUT DO NOT LET HIM Q YOU! You have to space
- If he walks up to CS, Q->PTA/Leg combo 
- You can use your E to small trade, try to flip him sideways rather than behind you.
   - Make space after you Flip so he can't Q easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he does choose to fight you, trading perma without having lethal is good for Warwick - being half HP or below is Warwick's win con
    - Even if it looks like it's going well at the start Warwick wins lane by being unkillable below 25% HP and then just outsustains you
- DON'T GET BAITED. Warwick wants to be low so he gets more damage + healing, and all his healing/tankiness is backloaded with his R/E
    - Also factor in his BARRIER + E
- Be careful of Warwick getting movement speed in lane early due to your team being low on the map

TIPS
- Get Executioner's first base, even if you have Ignite
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in autos without letting him Q onto you. They barely outrange his Q so spacing is very important as if he can get melee range onto you with this scaling setup you will lose
- You hard outscale at 9/1st item and executioners. He's turbo useless in teamfights and his wincon is cheesing lane to get fed'

- His animation "stops" when you flip the clone, the "real" one gets flipped smoother

- Respect HARD at Level 6, he can run you down

- His Q gives him a lot of range

- Use your range + Q to trade when he CSes, never look to E forwards unless he's in one shot with no clone

- You outscale Wukong by a little bit 1v1, it's always hard and comes down to who plays it better

- You can look to do a small E trade early. If he E's you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Do not prolong the fight, he wins with max Passive + Conq stacks

HOW TO TRADE
- The wincon for Urgot in this matchup is being tanky/healthy enough to hold E until after Wukong W clones during his all ins level 6-8
- Very important to not waste E or panic E if he engages on you, as he can just W clone to dodge it. 
- You need to be very patient and hold your E, Wukong usually has W for dmg: R -> W after knockup ends -> R to have enough damage to kill you
    - If you still have your E up you can threaten E flash ignite R one shot even if you're much lower
    - If you're confident, you can immediately E into his E. If you're fast with it, you can catch him in the E animation before he clones. This is generally risky though so best done later in the game/under your tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Wukong's Q range scales with Q level, and is about the same as your auto range at 9. His main poking pattern in lane is E minion -> Q so watch for this to not get poked down

TIPS
- Ignite early in fights so you cut his conq/passive healing immediately and don't risk igniting his clone
- You can always tell if you E Wukong or his clone, Eing the clone will have a weird "stop" animation and it wont be a fluid E. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN USE R IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FLIP OR NOT
- Outscale at 9/1st item
    - Keep in mind though that Wukong's main strength is his teamfighting, always try to mark him to watch flanks'

- If you pop Yasuo shield passive, can look for Q + PTA trade if he E's near you

- You have to predict Yasuo's dash to hit your E if you want to trade. Usually just E buffer away if he tries to run you down

- His Windwall blocks your entire kit, R1 AND R2

'
2025-05-04 23:11:11,354 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E203: Details='EARLY GAME
- If he's Q start, you can look to Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage small trade. Try to sidestep his first Q
- If he's E start, he'll dash thru minions. Once you're in range and he wants to dash thru you, E BEHIND YOURSELF

HOW TO TRADE
- Yasuo is a hard matchup as he has infinite dashes to dodge your E, Windwall blocks Q R1 and R2, and shield to win short trades as well while also winning long trades pre-9
- Winning this matchup comes down to being patient with your E, if you hit E you win. 
    - Be aware of your minions to see where he could possibly dash to, try to predict your E to knock him down
    - If you waste your E and he dodges it by dashing through minions you will get run down and die
- Look for E + Flash + R one shot when he's at 60%. 
    - He has to be a little lower than other champs because his windwall will instantly cut off all your damage once he gets unstunned.
- Just let him push you in and farm until you're 9, they usually hit the wave to stack Q


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His windwall will also block your R2 recast, so don't spam R2 unless you can execute him while he's stunned. Try to walk around it so it's not in between you and Yasuo if you can
- Buffering E into his Q3 -> R is really hard. If he tornados you, don't bother buffering E, save it until after his R

TIPS
- Try to take his passive with your leg splash damage
- The 1v1 just comes down to who plays it better/if you hit E post 9

- Never E when he has E1 up. His E2 immunes your flip (he'll still be stunned tho)

- Buffer E into his Q3, but care if its a max range Q3 as that outranges your E

- Buffer E backwards if he R's you

- You outscale at 9+, and generally outscale him the whole game if you're ahead

- Level 1 you can look to fight Yone, try to sidestep his Q before looking to E. 
- If he doesn't give E range, sidestep Q -> Leg + Auto is also good
- Should get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades are based around Yone W. Try to bait it out, then look for Q->PTA trades
- Never E Yone if he has E up. You want to buffer E when he Q3's forward
   - Be careful as Yone max range Q3 gives him enough space to click back and dodge Urgot E
- If Yone E > Q3s, just E to force his E snapback, or else he can take a beefy trade. 
   - In general, you never really have windows to E yone unless his E is on CD
- Look to E + Flash + R Yone at 70% HP. 
   - If he has E up to dodge your E FLash,  to make it less obvious, Q/Auto trade -> pretend to run away -> E + Flash when he rechases
- Urgot can buffer Yone R by E'ing BACKWARDS

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Until 9, Yone generally has stronger short trades with W, and long trades with lethal tempo. You can't force trades on him
   - Focusing on farming/going even until then is smart
- Be careful on wasting your E, it's really easy for Yone to re-engage with Q3/E and run you down

TIPS
- You smoke Yone after 9/Black Cleaver. I like going a lethality build after that since Yone is a hard scaling tank shredder, he gets one tapped

- You can look to fight Yorick hard early game, if he respects and starts E just play for level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- EXTREMELY LOW INTERACTION MATCHUP, Yorick just pushes you in post 6 with his infinite ghoul army
    - Sit under tower and farm
- This matchup comes down to sidestepping his E, it's his only ranged tool
    - The hitbox of it grows larger if you try to dodge backwards, but its quite narrow on the sides, so dodge it by side stepping side to side
    - When it's on cooldown you can Q->PTA trade as his ghouls won't auto target you
    - Play at his E max range so if it hits you, you have time to E away before he can cage you
- If he W cages you, your W won't target the cage unless there is absolutely nothing else to hit
    - Don't W and manually auto the cage to get out
- Post 6 it's heavily Yorick favored once he has his maiden, but can look to fight if it dies
- Fortunately Yorick auto pushes the lane with his maidens/ghouls so you can just scale for free
- If he somehow is <60% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Yorick Cage can knockdown and cancel your E.
- You no longer one shot his ghouls
- His Q heals for %missing HP, don't get baited thinking he's low, especially if you have no antiheal

TIPS
- Cull is a strong buy for some sustain in this lane since there's 0 kill potential
- He falls off after lane and you have more value in teamfights. The 1v1 is always difficult if he has maiden though

- If he starts Q try to dodge it, or wait until he slams you to E -> Auto
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Zac's Q cancels Urgot E at every point (casting or buffering), so you have to stand behind minions/dodge it. If he hits it he can full combo you Q->E->W
- Zac has infinite sustain, so we must use our range to trade
    - Q + PTA if he walks up for CS
    - Don't take mindless trades where he can W/auto, he will out sustain you easily. 
- If he E jumps you look to buffer your E on the shadow, then sidestep the followup Q he will throw at you in a straight line
- If played properly, this is mainly a farming lane. Slow push big waves and try to build a CS lead. Zac is quite hard to kill if he doesn't want to die and they almost always will play passive to scale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Don't get baited into flashing on him early game, his revive blobs are really hard to kill in time if you've used your E/W already
- Make sure you can insta kill if you flash before he Ults, the knockup and heal buy a lot of time

TIPS
- STEP ON THE BLOBS! 
- Rush executioners, Zac's entire 1v1 capability is based around his absurd healing, level 6+ do not try to all in unless you have antiheal
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver/Executioners, and for the rest of the game

- Play aggro lvl 1-3

- Play around his Q CD to trade

- Flip on his Q2 + E

- Try your best to go even lvl 3-8, he's really strong with Plated Steelcaps

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9'
2025-05-04 23:29:20,154 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E5: Details='EARLY GAME
- Get behind Aatrox and look to fight level 1.
    - Try to bait out the Q1 by spacing max range
    - Walk closer and Auto + E in his Q2 animation (Need to be inner edge of Q2)
    - If you FLIP, click away from Q3 and trade autos/PTA

HOW TO TRADE:
- It's all about spacing and playing around his Q. 
- Goal is to trade with Q/Autos/PTA when his Q is on CD. Repeat until hes ~70%, and you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill.

- You cannot flip Aatrox in Q1 + E, it's too long. Look to FLIP on his Q2 + E
    - Aatrox Q1 + Es forward, sidestep side to side 
    - Q2, click away, then click towards him to try to get him to Q2 + E FORWARDS. This is where you try to FLIP him.
    - Make space so he can't Q3 you after FLIPPING

- This lane is really hard if you can't find leads pre-6/first base, as he can slowly poke you down at range with Q1 + E forever. 
- Only look to E if his E is on cooldown


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Q1 damage is hard to avoid, but does minimal damage. Getting hit by Q2 is a lot more damage, so be careful with spacing/buffering E into Q2
- Good Aatrox's will mix up E'ing forwards on Q2, be careful not to get baited. 
- Hard lane as you have to be very knowledgable if your E hits or not. If you miss E/fail E buffer into his Q, you will take too much damage
- Once Aatrox gets Plated Steelcaps, the MS + armor make it extremely hard to trade back
   - Try to fight hard first 3 levels, if he's not behind and TPs back with Steelcaps it's cooked
- Ignite (or anti-heal) is mandatory if you try to kill him. Have to know lethal limits well in this matchup, as he can heal with Passive + Q above 25% if you try to E flash him

TIPS
- You can "ride" Aatrox W pull by buffering E. Useful in catching them off guard if they're prepping W -> Q under your tower for instance
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver'

- Don't E if she has her E up. During all-ins be patient with E W/E and R

2025-05-04 23:29:20,155 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E8: Details='EARLY GAME
- Akali is weak level 1, get behind her and fight
   - If she skills Q, FLIP on her empowered auto. If she skills E, she will not Q as you walk up, so just use your ranged autos to trade and hold E

HOW TO TRADE
- Once Akali gets her W and E, this matchup gets hard as you can't FLIP until she's used both W and E
- Wiggle around her max Q range, if she misses Q, you can look for small Q/leg/PTA trades. 
   - Repeat until she's ~70% HP and you can look for Flash + E + R + Ignite lethal before she can shroud or E away
      - Ignite can tick her down for 25% ult lethal when she's in shroud
- If she hits Q, use your Q slow to space her - you can't trade back if she drops shroud, and taking poke in this lane is bad
- Only look to play small trades around her Q cd/energy levels (if she doesnt get empowered auto off she can only Q twice) until she's in oneshot range. Respect until then and outscale
- Her W and E have long CDs, so if she wastes them look to trade aggressively

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Post 6, Akali can one shot you from ~80% HP, especially if you're pushed up. 
   - You can't reliably E until she's used her E, W, and R, so it's very hard to live. Really focus on not taking bad trades and be respectful (esp if she has Ignite)
- Never E at her directly if she has E up, she can dodge it with her E easily

TIPS
- Buying MR or HP early (negatron/phage) over AD early is better, as you need to be able to tank her abilities before you can E. AD is not as good early on unless as you can't hit her while she's shrouded
- You can buffer your E into her E2 
- Outscale at 9, and hard outscale for the rest of the game. 
   - You get too tanky to oneshot, and you can just leave W on and chunk her everytime she exits shroud to Q/Auto'

- You can look to fight Akshan level 1, but he has to face check you in bush/walk into E range. 
   - If he respects the cheese, don't overforce it. His range and Q slow can kite you out level 1, and he can trade autos with you early.
- He's very strong early, so just focus on farming/Q poke if he doesn't mess up. Your kill windows are at 6 with Ult + Ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Look to Q+Leg/PTA trade after Akshan uses his Q, the slow from it is what sets up his trading patterns. Without it, he's vulnerable
   - Remember to not stand behind minions as it extends his Q range
   - If he hits Q, run away and try to space him with your Q slow to deny his followup Autos. 
- Repeat until you can set up lethal. He's very squishy so you can E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal at 6 from ~80% HP. 
- Hard to E Akshan without Flash, he has high range + E to disengage. Don't force trades and play around his Q CD

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He hits HARD, so be careful about letting him get the Q + double hit passive + PTA trades on you.  
- His invisiblity makes good roams, so make sure to MIA ping when he's gone.
- Akshan is a very snowbally champ, take care to not die early and fall behind. If he has strong item bases, his trades are unplayable, but if he doesn't get a lead he dies whenever your Flash is up

TIPS
- Go Dirk/AD items first base if you have Ignite + Flash up at level 6. If you're flash is down, build Plated Steelcaps. 
- His E can be body blocked to knock him down, try to stand in his E path if you get on top of him.'

- She has really high CDs, if she wastes her abilities (especially her W shield) or gets too close, look to trade

- Favored at 9/Black Cleaver, you outscale but need to hit your E

- Do not E if she Ults, it will cancel your E

- Really try to fight her level 1, as once she gets level 3+ it's hard to ever hit E.
- Get behind her in the bush and try to PREDICT her Q dash when you E. Getting a good trade in level 1 makes this lane a lot more playable
   - Even if you miss E, you can still win the trade with E shield + PTA/legs 

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is difficult with Ambessa because you can't reliably E until she's used all her abilities. Mainly just try to sustain/minimize trading, she has high sustain and no mana costs so she can poke you out hard.
- Ambessa dictates the trades due to her mobility, play around short Q + W/PTA trades when she's in your range
- When she Q1 dashes in -> Q2 dashes out, stand in your wave.
   - Her Q2 does reduced damage if it hits a minion first, and will push the wave back to you as well
   - You can also look to predict E if she gets in range if you are near your tower. Even if you miss, the shield will help the trade
- She has really high CDs, so if she wastes her abilities (especially her shield W), or dashes too close into your E range, look to trade. If she doesn't mess up though, you don't really have windows to fight back unfortunately.
- Really hard to kill Ambessa pre-9. After 9, you can look to take extended trades while she's in between CDs.
- Don't be afraid to E + Flash to kill, really hard to land E on her normally.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Ambessa R will CANCEL your E, never try to buffer E into her R
- Her shielding, passive omnivamp, doran's shield + grasp, and no mana costs makes her a really insane laner. You have to be very careful with your HP/Mana, if you fall behind this lane gets omega hard.

TIPS
- Ambessa's damage is all up front in burst/shielding, and then she has long CDs. If she's still in range, look to fight, especially post-9. 
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind. You do outscale Ambessa if you can hit E, but she scales very very well too.'

2025-05-04 23:29:20,157 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E17: Details='EARLY GAME
- Aurora is not weak early game due to her passive, but you can still fight her. 
- Get behind her and try to push her into the river. She has high range, so if she doesn't int, just use E to gapclose/shield Auto -> E -> Auto -> Auto (PTA), then disengage.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is based around Aurora Q CD. If she has Q up, you have to respect, as it sets up her passive/electrocute trades too well.
   - Try to bait out her Q at max range, then you can look for a Q + PTA/Legs trade.
   - If she has Q up, only look to Q for trading, don't Auto
- Repeat until shes at ~70% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite + R lethal.
- I like to take Ignite in this lane as playing small, slow trades usually favors Aurora. You have to all-in, and Ignite + early AD items lets you E + Flash at much higher HP levels. 
   - Ignite also helps as if she has a second to R away, Ignite can still tick her down and get you the kill
- Really important in this lane to not let her get free passive procs off, as it gives her sustain. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- When you E + Flash Aurora, make sure you can kill in the E stun. She has a lot of tools to escape/time out your ultimate.
- Aurora E is actually a buffer, good Auroras can buffer your E with her E. Be a little careful of immediately ulting after E + Flash if they can do this.
- Make sure you don't waste Flash, you have no kill potential without Flash and she can just bully you under tower for 5 minutes.
- She can actually dodge your R2 with her R teleport, but it's really hard to time. Not something you have to really play around.

TIPS
- Keep track of her dashes (W and E), as they have long CDs. If she wastes them you can look to take really aggressive trades. '

2025-05-04 23:29:20,158 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E20: Details='EARLY GAME
- You absolutely have to try to cheese/fight Azir level 1, this is the only level where this matchup is playable
- Get behind him and just try to trade as much as possible. E to gapclose/shield if you can't get in range, this will help you get prio for level 2, then look for E +Flash with Ignite.

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is very difficult because Azir bullies you in lane, outranges you, outscales you, and is also hard to gank.
- You cannot play this lane slowly, Azir will always win.  You have to make it volatile and play for a fast E + Flash + Ignite + R oneshot before he pokes you down too much
- Try your best to avoid his Soldier + Q poke trades, and look to Q poke whenever you can. You will usually take more damage, but you can one shot him from much higher HP.
   - If you can find pockets that his soldiers aren't in, you can look to Q + PTA trade. 
- You NEED Flash to kill Azir. Without Flash he will just bully you for 5 minutes under tower, his range is too high for a normal E. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- You have to give CS in this matchup to preserve HP. If you have no way to reset, be very careful tanking his Soldier + Q combo, as if you get too low you can't threaten all in even with summs up.
- You need your jungler to gank you in this matchup, but it's hard to gank Azir as he has his dash + ult to disengage. 
- Be careful of E'ing in too close to his tower, as he can R you into tower aggro

TIPS
- You can buffer your E into his R, the interaction is a little buggy. If your E connects with Azir as he R's you, you will not be pushed and can flip Azir

- Look to get behind Camille and trade level 1. As soon as the wave meets in the middle, look for an Auto -> E. 
   - If you time the E right, you will flip her before she gets her passive up
   - Don't immediately auto again, look to create space so you can get 1-2 more autos for PTA proc in before she can auto you for her Passive shield

HOW TO TRADE
- Camille's W is the main ability to play around, as she cannot get her passive/Qs on you without the slow. 
  - Whenever her W is on CD, we can trade
   - Q her and run at her -> prepare to click backwards to dodge the W -> once her W is gone, look for PTA/Leg trade
      - The slow from Q and MS from Approach Velocity makes it really easy to bait out Camille W this way
- You can buffer E into camille E, so they can't just force E trades on you.
   - Be careful when Camille's are hovering walls, if they're right next to a wall their E can come out surprisingly fast, making it hard to react E to.
- You cannot let her hit W -> Q1/Q2 with Passive shield combo, you will lose too much HP and then she can threaten lethal. 
- If her passive is down and she is not near a wall, you can look to E and trade hard

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Camille's main strength is her gank setup, MAKE SURE TO TRACK ENEMY JUNGLE and not overextend if you don't have vision. 
- Camille R can dodge your E and your R, so usually you need to buffer your E into her E, or E + Flash her to guarantee your E -> R landing.
   - Camille can buffer her her own E -> R, so if she knows you can E her E, be careful of this interaction
- Camille E (hookshot) can buffer your E if it hasn't "attached" to the wall when she's flipped. If you Flip her AFTER it attaches, it will fizzle and she will die. 
- You CANNOT fall behind Camille in lane, or you can never play as she can engage on you from 2 screens out perma

TIPS
- You outscale Camille at 9/Black Cleaver. Generally you win 1v1 vs her all game, but you have to hit E. 
- Your ignite and R go through her passive shield. You can tick her below lethal with Ignite even if she gets the shield.'

- Even if you can't kill her, chunking her is still really good as it sets her up for lethal at level 2 with Ignite + Flash + E

HOW TO TRADE
- Can't play slow trades in this lane, as her Q will eventually poke you out. Play aggressive with your Flash up.
- Even and slightly losing trades are still ok as you can threaten lethal as long as she isn't full HP
- Dodge her Q, then look for Q->PTA small trades to poke her down. If she has Q up, you can Q, but do not go for Autos.
   - If she hits Q, wait out the poison
   - Repeat until she's ~80% HP, then look for E + Flash + Ignite lethal. 
- Q -> click forwards -> click backwards to try to bait our her Q, they get scared when slowed and you run at them
- Cassio is really squishy at 6 with Ignite, you can oneshot her from really high HP. Just be careful that you don't take too much poke damage. 
- After 6, with enough MS, you can Q -> Run at her -> Buffer E through her R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Do not fight if she lands Q on you
- Be careful of being stunned when near bushes, she can Ult -> W combo you
- Her extended trade is really strong with E spam + Conq, you can't Flip her from full HP, she has to be chunked a little before or she ramps too hard
- Cassio buys a lot of HP (ROA), and even armor sometimes. The matchup gets hard if she hasn't fallen behind and she buys Catalyst first back, as she has too much HP to oneshot now

TIPS
- You can buffer E through her grounding (W) and R, use this to not get caught out. If she can W you, the slow + inability to E will take too much of your HP
- With W on, you can dodge Cassio R by clicking BEHIND YOU. 
   - Visually you'll still face her, but YOU WON'T GET STUNNED
   - Cassio's R stun logic goes off of where your last click was (towards or away from Cass) not your visual model

- Farm matchup, you can't kill Cho through his passive sustain

- Wiggle around/dodge his Q, look for a Q->PTA trade if you do

- He has infinite sustain, so pay attention to your mana/HP, don't overuse Q while trading

- Hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver,  you hard counter him in teamfights with Legs %HP + R'
2025-05-04 23:29:20,160 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E29: Details='EARLY GAME
- Get behind him and fight level 1, Cho'gath's early is super weak. 
- If he takes Q, try to buffer E through his Q. 

HOW TO TRADE
- Cho'Gath's passive sustain makes him hard to kill in lane, focus on dodging his Q's and E. 
- You can only look to trade with Q + PTA/legs if his Q is down. If he has Q, do not lock yourself in auto animation in his Q range.
- If you dodge his Q, can look to E forwards if he's still in range
- BE VERY CAREFUL with your HP/mana management. Cho'gath's win con is just slowly chunking you down
   - If you trade, make sure you don't take too much creep damage
- Don't use Q too much in this lane, it costs too much mana. Only use Q if it can setup heavier legs + PTA trades.
- Ideally just trade minimally and scale up

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you're pushed up in the lane, be careful of getting run down pre-9 by Q/E slow CC chain. 1 Q is all it takes if you don't have Phase Rush
- Be mindful of his sustain. Try to avoid trading when he has a big minion wave to eat and sustain up

TIPS
- PTA gives you more laning power, but Phase Rush is also really good in this matchup. He can never kill you as you can just run away with Phase Rush, helps with staying even in lane until you can outscale
- You hard outscale Cho'Gath after 9/Black Cleaver, and if you have followup in teamfights your legs + R execute make him significantly squishier than he usually is.
- Early Cull in this lane to match his sustain feels really nice
- You can buffer your E through his Q and W, after 9 if you E him you win. 
   - If you E him and his Q is up, try to immediately move before autoing as he will likely panic Q on top of himself.

- Don't fight level 1 until the minons arrive and crash
- Some Darius's will start W and try to cheese YOU by getting behind you. If he runs from behind you, stand your ground in your wave and Flip him to disengage
- Usually they'll start Q, and try to Q the first 3 creeps, look to space it and get a chunk in. You should always get level 2 Prio as you are ranged.

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades in this matchup are based around Darius Q. 
   - Bait it out by wiggling at max range, when it's on CD look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades to chunk him
- Goal is to chunk him to 70%HP before looking for an extended all in. With Ignite and at that HP, he can't get to 5 stacks in time. If you fight 100% to 100% HP, he will have time to 5 stack you and win.
   - But we can only look for these chunks when his Q is on CD
   - Try to freeze lane as much as possible, so we can poke without getting run down
   - When it pushes out, try to slow push. A big minon wave helps if he tries to all in you in the long lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, especially early game, as Darius wants to run you down
- If you miss E, you die
   - Watch out for being in positions where if Darius can just flash your E and then run you down
- If he ever gets a free Q/starts with stacks, don't fight
- Do not Flip forwards aggressively unless Darius is ~70%HP. If he survives at low HP (which he will if >70%HP), he can E->Q with 5 stacks for a gigaheal

TIPS
- You have kill potential on Darius at every stage of the game, but it's Darius favored pre-6. You hard win at 9/Black Cleaver.
- You can buffer his pull (E) with your E, but it's a hard timing to pull off. Try to predict when he'll E you.
   - If you buffer his E you guaranteed win, as he can't get to the outside Q edge.
- In this matchup, missing E is death. Don't hesitate to E flash, as he can easily dodge with flash/ghost. 
- Don't be afraid! You have to stand your ground in this matchup, if you E away defensively you will lose. '

- Really try to get behind and fight Mundo level 1. If you can E -> pop his passive off level 1, it makes the lane significantly easier
- If you chunk him enough, you can easily E + Flash + Ignite one shot at level 2.
   - Usually Mundo's run Ghost TP, so if they don't have Flash it's guaranteed.

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a neutral scaling matchup, it's not that bad for Urgot as long as you stand behind minions to avoid Mundo's Q/E damage
   - You can't really stop his farming with Q, and he can't really stop your farming if you stand behind minions
- You should never be able to E Mundo as he can outrange with Q, so you can't even take his passive
- Everytime Mundo walks up for CS or misses Q, look for a small Q + PTA/Legs trade to chunk him. 
   - Do the same when he's at his tower CS'ing, just poke him down.
   - He has really low health regen in lane, so damage actually sticks to him
- When Mundo is at ~60/70%, to kill:
   - Lead off with R -> E + Flash with the R slow. The E pops off the passive, then you can circle around and execute with R2.
   

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Mundo passive denies your E AND your R2 pull. 
- Your E does not lock-on your W if he has his passive

TIPS
- You outscale at level 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game if not behind. 
   - Most Mundos stack HP and not armor, so your legs + R %HP damage hit HARD in the 1v1 and in teamfights
- If you have Ignite/anti-heal, Mundo's R at rank 1 barely heals. You can execute him with R easily still.
- His passive has a really long CD early, be sure to step on it if you pop it off

- If she Qs a vital, make sure you Q + PTA trade as she runs away. Important you don't miss Q as you can't lock on/trade with her otherwise

- Unless Fiora facechecks you in a brush and you have Ignite, don't fight until after minions arrive. Her vitals heal way too much level 1
- Level 1, try to predict E when she goes to Q your vital. You should be able to secure level 2 prio with your range

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup comes down to forcing out her Parry (W) with damage, before you have to use your E
- If Fiora has W up, only ever use E when:
   - Predicting E when they go to Q a vital
   - E + Flash
       - When doing this, auto -> walk backwards -> then insta E + flash to not make your intentions obvious
   - Intentionally missing E to bait out the parry
- Whenever Fiora Q's, tag her with a Q + PTA trade on the way out.
   - Important to not miss your Q, as then you can't lock on in the wave and she can hard out trade you
- Try to kite the parry/vitals, if she misses Q (or doesn't get the vital MS) this is your window to trade back
- Level 6+, use R to bait out the parry
   - E is more important to land, especially because parrying E will stun you as well.
- Pre-9, it's 50/50, but you have kill potential if you play it well. At level 9 until 2-3 items, you hard win as she eats every leg trying to proc vitals

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful when Q'ing when she wants to Q a vital, she can Q over your Q and then it's hard to trade
- She can parry your E and both casts of your R
- Be mindful of your vitals, if she gets too many free ones with Q + Grasp, you'll be too low to all-in. Important to not fall behind in this lane due to her scaling

TIPS
- Anti-heal is necessary if you don't have Ignite. Bramble is better early for lane, but executioner's scales harder.
- You can reset bad vitals by walking out of range of Fiora
- Position near walls during her R so you can block a vital by hugging a wall.
- After you E + Flash, unless she's super low, don't spam R2 as Fiora's will spam parry as soon as they're unstunned, and may parry your R2 this way
- Fiora outscales you at 3+ items, she just does way too much damage. Important to establish leads before then.
- You can Ctrl + 3 fake Ult emote to try to bait out her parry (best on pj/butcher skins) (https://x.com/quantelol/status/1729204401838158066/video/1)'

- Level 1, definitely look to fight GP:
    - GP's will usually start Barrel (E), and have one prepped in the bush.
    -  If you manage to sneak into the bush and he doesn't see you as minions crash, look for auto + E on GP, then KILL THE BARREL while he's stunned. You can also look to auto the barrel at the start 
    - If he respects the cheese, try to wiggle around the 2nd barrel's chain range to bait it out.  You can E + leg auto to gapclose/shield through the barrel explosion
    - You should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup is based around his Barrels (E) and his Q. Always wiggle at 2nd barrel chain range to see if you can bait it out.
   - If he wastes/misses his barrels, look to Flip him, or if not in range for E, a Q + PTA/leg trade is good. 
       - He has an indicator below his HP bar of how many barrels he has left
   - Respect his Q range, especially once he has SHEEN. 
       - Early game his Q only hurts with Grasp up, but after Sheen it is REALLY IMPORTANT you don't let him just perma Q you. 
       - Farm/space with your Q, hide in bushes, don't let him Q you on cooldown. 
       - If he Q's you, try to Q + PTA trade back if there are no barrels around
- GP is really weak without his barrels, if you can pop, dodge, or walk around his barrel radius, you can take heavy trades. 
   - Try to always space far enough out to make him use at least 2 barrels
- When GP is ~60% HP (or if he wastes his Oranges), you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R all in. The ignite is nice as it really cuts his Orange healing. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- HIS ORANGE CAN CLEANSE YOUR R2 EXECUTE. You need to force him to Orange (W) thru damage, before your Ult times out and auto pulls. 
   - This requires high knowledge of your damage. Be sure that if you all-in GP, he's not too high HP and you hold your ultimate for a little so it doesn't time out. 
   - Only press R once! This way it won't auto cast and he can just Orange (W) out. 
- Good GP's will look to Orange (W) your E stun when you E + Flash. Be patient with your R after you E + Flash, because if they orange the E stun they won't be behind you like normal


TIPS
- It's a hard matchup (esp vs Dshield/Grasp GP) until 9 vs good GP, he can just space you perma. After 9/Black Cleaver, and especially at level 13/2 items, you hard beat GP if you hit E. He outscales in teamfights at full build though
- Really really important you don't fall behind after GP gets SHEEN until 9. It's really braindead point and click no counterplay spell, you have to respect and not take too much damage
- At level 9, with no minions around, the matchup gets a lot easier as it's really easy to pop his barrels with W'

- Look to fight Garen really hard early game. If they start E, Auto -> E -> Space their E -> PTA
- If they start W, it's impossible to deal meaningful damage, just look for a PTA proc then drop minion aggro in brush.
- You have complete wave control in this matchup until the wave crashes and bounces back, around level 3

HOW TO TRADE
- If Garen has W up, E'ing into him will always be negative, as even if you win the short trade he will outsustain your HP/mana eventually
- I play this lane by lane-locking garen with my Teleport (with reduced CD from Cosmic Insight), and stacking large item leads on him
    - I don't like to play to fistfight/trade with Garen, as he has infinite resources
    - If we trade hard early game, I'll use my first TP for a Cull buy, else I usually want Phage (1100g) or Pickaxe + Long Sword (1225g)
- Keep your spacing TIGHT. Always keep him at range. If he runs at you with Q, Q him to make space and autos
    - Use your range and autoattacks (no mana cost) in this matchup as much as possible
    - Again, if you try to trade by E'ing at Garen with W, you will just lose out in the long run due to mana costs/lack of sustain
    -  You can look to E the Garen as he Q's at you if he's not as good, sometimes they won't W. Depends on the elo.
- Your Q is only worth the mana to stop his passive from ticking, or to setup a PTA + leg trade. Q alone is not worth the mana for it's damage here
- After flipping Garen, make sure to space a little bit to get out of his E range before following up with Autos
- Always look to stop Garen's passive from ticking, especially if he's lower HP


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Garen cleanses slows with his Q, so make sure you Q him AFTER he Q's when trading
- Keep track of his Phase Rush, it gives slow resists too so if it's active, careful with your R as he'll just run away.
- Garen's love to proxy, especially if they fall behind. Try to keep vision in the river/think to yourself "can he go proxy here?" and stop him from doing so. 
- At 9, make sure you don't turn your W off when he Q (silences you). 
   

TIPS
- You hard outscale Garen at 9/Black Cleaver, you just stat check Garen and lose little DPS when silenced.
- If he has Conqueror + Ignite, you have to be very very respectful level 6+. Taking one trade will put you in lethal range.
   - Conq Garen is USELESS after you hit level 9, and is very weak in teamfights.
   - Phase Rush Garen needs Ignite to kill in lane, but generally has much weaker kill pressure, but scales much harder and can play sidelane later on vs Urgot.

- Really important to fight Gnar level 1 after minions crash. Walk behind him, if he starts Q: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA is 70% of his HP, and sets up a really easy E + Flash + Ignite kill
- If they're good, they'll skill jump (E). BE READY FOR THIS AND HOVER YOUR MOUSE BEHIND YOU to prepare for him double jumping off you
   - If you're fast enough you'll still flip him mid-jump
- If you can Flip/chunk Gnar level 1, it makes your game way easier to play
- Even if you can't Flip him, you hard win by just Eing forwards + legs + PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This matchup doesn't start out too bad, but gets progressively worse as Gnar gets more items. Plated Steelcaps, Phage, Q slow + W MS makes it really hard to touch Mini Gnar, and Mega Gnar does too much damage
   - You really want to force his TP before he gets gold for Plated Steelcaps (1200g) as the lane is UNPLAYABLE afterwards, that's why the level 1 chunk is important
- Play around his Q. If it's up you have to respect his range, but if he uses/misses it, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade.
   - Good movement in this lane to dodge Q, especially Mega Gnar Q, is SUPER important. Hitting one Q -> W passive proc lets him chain run you down for a huge chunk
- When he's in Mega Gnar, you have to be very respectful. Just let it time out and look to re-aggro when he's Mini
   - You CAN Buffer E into his Mega Gnar W/R, which is helpful, but he's so over-statted in Mega you can still lose so be careful
- At 60-70%, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot, just know your damage levels as he can double hop (E) out if you don't kill in the stun.
- When you E or E + Flash Gnar, always click to the side so he can't double hop (E) out after the stun expires


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you haven't gotten a lead by the time gnar gets Plated Steelcaps and/or Phage, just play passively and scale. 
   - It's unrealistic to force trades on Gnar with these items
- Be careful of fighting when he's close to Mega Gnar, he gets a lot of HP/resistances
- Be respectful of his double hop (E) on a minion -> transform -> Mega Gnar R -> W combo, it has super high range and can easily kill/chunk you

TIPS
- Gnar scales pretty well, at 9/Black Cleaver is when the matchup becomes even again, but it's not favored. Gnar's scaling is pretty even to Urgot's, it just depends if you can hit E on him while in Mini Gnar if you win or not
- If he's low rage at the start of teamfights, look to focus him before he can transform.

- Look to get behind Gragas level 1 and fight. Gragas usually starts Body Slam (E), so make sure you are READY to buffer E into his E, you can take 70% of his HP if you do
- Should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Buffering your E into Gragas E is the main way you trade in this lane. Always have your E prepared, as you hard win if you successfully buffer it
- If Gragas doesn't E, you don't really have many options. He will stand back and throw barrels (Q) while healing from his passive, it's very low interaction
   - Good movement to dodge his Q is very important, try not to stand on minions so he has to choose between farming or poking
- It's hard for Gragas to walk up melee range to CS, you can Q + Auto/Leg if he does. They will usually farm with barrels
   - If they use/miss their barrel (Q), look to run at Gragas and take a Q + PTA trade. Again, prepare yourself to potentially buffer his E if he slams at you here
- Repeat until he's ~60-70% HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal. 
   - Make sure you know your damage as his R + E can let him escape really easily if not one shot

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Buffering Gragas E is tricky if he's right on top of you. Try to leave some space in between so you have more time to react.
- A lot of Gragas's will look to knock you into tower with R, but you can buffer Gragas R with E
   - Save your E to try to bait out his ult, it's really easy to outplay
- Gragas W auto is AOE, be careful to not stand too close to his target minion for the splash damage

TIPS
- Gragas is annoying in lane due to his Q + passive healing playstyle, but it's not the worst and you hard outscale him in the 1v1, and in teamfights too. Focus on not taking too much poke and farming up

- You can look to get behind Graves and fight level 1, they usually start E so hitting your E is hard. Just Auto -> E for gap close -> Auto Auto PTA still wins the trade
- It's a little hard to get prio for level 2 because Graves AOE autos, but try to match his autos. If you chunked him level 1, you can one shot with E + Flash + Ignite at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Graves's game plan is to spam push the wave in, and slowly chip you down with auto/Q poke. He has very low 1v1/trading power
- Look to Q + PTA/Leg trade whenever you can. His Q has a long snapback time, so you can fight even if his Q is up, but definitely look to trade if he Q's the wave
- Only look to E him if his dash (E) has been used. He has no reason to use it as he outranges your E with autos, so it's hard to force it out.
   - Also remember that his E stacks give him armor
- Repeat until hes at ~70% HP, then you can kill with E + Flash + Ignite + R, depending on his grit (armor from E) stacks

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his Q bounce angles, especially under tower. That's his main source of poke damage
- If you E + Flash, smokescreen + E + R are effective escape tools, so make sure you have lethal in the stun


TIPS
- Early Dirk/AD items in this lane feel really nice with Ignite. It's hard to play slow poke into graves (he has fleet + lifesteal usually for sustain), so just threatening the all-in E + Flash immediately is effective
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver and for the rest of the game, especially with Flash up

- Level 1 walk behind her and fight. If they skill Q, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage is a great trade. 
- If they skilled E and use it to dodge your E, just look for Auto + Leg then disengage

HOW TO TRADE
- Look for Q -> PTA/Leg trades when she has 0-1 Q stacks, or if her Q or E are on CD. Don't let her stack Q on minions for free, always look to sneak in Auto/Qs.
- If she has 3-4 stacks, you have to be careful, dodge side to side so Gwen Q->E won't clip you in the center
   - You can look to predict E when she Q->E's forward ONLY if she's below 70%HP. If she's full HP, she'll win the extended trade with a 2nd Q rotation + Conq
- Never E Gwen if she has E up, she can dodge it easily
   - Make sure if you do E, you hit it. Don't be afraid to E + Flash, if you miss E you die
- If Gwen wastes E and she's below 70%HP, you can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all-in.
   - If she has E up, they can react to E + Flash if they're good and it's riskier
- If Gwen wastes W she's also extremely vulnerable and you can look for trades

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Gwen's Shroud (W) makes this matchup quite hard. Gwen can Q->E with Shroud (W) up so you can't hit back, be careful that you don't click into her melee range trying to click on her
- If you E Gwen from outside the shroud, you'll still Flip. HOWEVER:
   - SUPER SECRET MECHANIC: If Gwen stands on the PIXEL EDGE of her Shroud (W), your E will go through her and die. This mechanic makes the matchup SUPER HARD vs Gwen's that know this.
- Her shroud can block your R2 if you go outside of it

TIPS
- A lot of Gwen's damage is backloaded (Q4, R3), and Urgot's R execute + Ignite is a good way of dealing with that if she's chunked out enough at the start
- Gwen's usually don't take Flash, and the champion is really vulnerable to ganks. Calling your jungler if you have E + Flash up is a good way to kill Gwen
- Gwen is pretty strong in lane nowdays, and scales well. If you snowball you destroy her but she will always be useful if she can get to 3+ items

2025-05-04 23:29:20,170 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E59: Details='EARLY GAME
- Heimer is not a matchup you can fuck with level 1 as his turrets are very strong.
- You can only fight if you have Ignite and he facechecks you, which is unlikely. Just let him push you in

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really low interaction matchup that you can't really look for trades in. Heimer just pushes you in perma, and you get to scale up.
- You can look for small Q poke, but going for Autos is risky as if he grenades (E) you, you lose way too much HP.
- When he grenades (E) you, buffer your E away so you don't tank the charged beam from the towers. 
- Stand behind minions to avoid the rocket (W) poke.
- If Heimer gets low enough or wastes his E, you can one shot with E + Flash + R, but its hard as if he doesn't die within the E stun, you will always die. You can still die even if you kill him as his towers will still hit

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Although it's very unfun, you should be careful of calling your jungler to gank Heimerdinger unless it's obviously free. He has easy 2v1 potential if either of you misplay the gank.
- You can't hit his towers without them hitting you back, your range is too short. 
- He gets lots of MS around his towers, so be careful when Q'ing or E + Flashing
- Be careful of facechecking bushes, he can oneshot you from full HP with some AP

TIPS
- Heimer is a champ that requires lots of kills in lane to be useful later. If you can just farm evenly (or even slightly behind), you'll be 2x his usefulness in teamfights later
- Early negatron/mercs rush is not bad.  You can also play Ignite if you're a Chad and try to kill.

- Stand behind minions and focus on dodging E, if it's up you can't trade hard

- Definitely want to try to fight Illaoi hard level 1, and pre-6 in general. She becomes impossible to kill post-6 with her R
- Get behind her and look to fight. Try to fight outside of tentacle range, Illaoi W start + tentacles nearby can actually trade with Urgot level 1
- You should get prio. If you don't manage to fight until minions arrive, respect her Q range, or if she isn't Qing be ready to E her W if she W's at you 

HOW TO TRADE
- Illaoi E is the main ability you have to play around. If it's up, especially post-6, you cannot go aggro
   - You can look to trade as hard as you want if she misses it, this is your main window
   - If she hits it, try to exit the tether range ASAP to avoid damage. 
- Always stand behind minions, and try to Q + PTA/Leg trade when she CSes. 
   - You have to be respectful of her Q as well though, have good spacing and don't let her slap you for free
- Illaoi loves to try to hump you under tower, fishing for Es/Qs. This is the only window where you can look to kill Illaoi with E + Flash + R, as she self stuns with her ability animations, and it's easy for her to get tower aggro
- You can kill pre-6 with Ignite, but after 6 it's entirely Illaoi favored

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Illaoi's ult makes her displacement immune, meaning if well timed she can immune your E flip. If the Illaoi is good, you'll almost always have to look for a E + Flash to kill
- Illaois like to Q/W + tentacle the wave to insta kill your minions, opening you up for a surprise E. Be careful for this
- The tentacles still slap, even if you kill them
- Be careful of calling your jungler to gank Illaoi unless its for sure free, she can easily 2v1.
   - Both of you have to dodge the E if you want to gank

TIPS
- If she has no tentacles when she grabs your E, it won't do anything really. You don't have to exit the tether range and can stand your ground and trade back
- Illaoi is a champ that can only lane, unless you have 5 melee champs. She's useless in teamfights so going even and scaling up is a win for Urgot
- The "scaling" in this matchup is dependent on if you dodge Illaoi E or not, she will always be able to kill if she hits it'

- Look hard to fight Irelia level 1. If you can E her before the minions get low and she can't Q away, you smoke her
- If Irelia doesn't appear until the minions are low, be careful of her dodging your E by QQQ'ing the first 3 minions -> Q you with full passive
   - In this scenario, try to predict your E into her Q on the minions
- If Irelia starts E, try to zone her off the first 3 EXP. If she walks up you fist her

HOW TO TRADE
- Trading is determined on how many stacks she has/she can get: 
   - When the wave is pushing into you, show respect pre-9, she has max stacks 
   - When the wave is pushing into her, you have to be careful. Try to walk AHEAD of your wave and fight her so she can't dash around thru your wave
   - MAKE SURE YOUR WAVE CRASHES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK IRELIAS FREEZE 1v1
- If she E->Q's you, E behind yourself, not at her, or it will miss
- HOLD YOUR E UNTIL GUARANTEED. They will always try to bait it out with Q dash. 
- If she wastes W, you can look to play aggressive, they usually use it to setup the minion wave to Q through, so be careful  you don't miss E
- You have to stand your ground and fight with Ignite in this matchup, if she can fight you in your minion wave and win you can't play the game


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very patient with your E, always pay attention if she's trying to bait it with a minion to Q to. 
- Her W gives her damage reduction, so don't ult too early if she negates your E damage with W
- She powerspikes hard on BORK and Plated Steelcaps
- If she gets a freeze on you pre-9, hopefully your jungler comes to help, but if not look to roam or put pressure on the map. YOU CAN'T BREAK IT SOLO

TIPS
- This is a very difficult matchup vs good Irelias, and if you make one mistake they can freeze on you forever. 
   - Really focus on playing aggro first 3 waves, and then respecting afterwards if she doesn't fuck up
- You turbo outscale Irelia, especially in teamfights, as long as you get your EXP you're fine.
- Can rush bramble vest + plated steelcaps yourself if you fall behind, your base damage at 9 can stat check her hard

- If you take the brush, Auto -> E -> Space out his E while he's stunned -> Auto Auto PTA

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane pre-9 you always want to play for the freeze. Jax wants the long lane to run you down with max passive stacks
    - Never fight when the wave is pushing into you
    - Jax has a hard time breaking freezes and will eat a lot of damage while being vulnerable to ganks.
    - Very important to look to poke Jax while wave is frozen so when it bounces out you can kill him before he ramps his stacks up
- Very E cooldown-based matchup, whoever E's first loses. Always Buffer your E into his E
    - If you E his E, always click away to not get stunned before Autoing again
- Your Q is also super important, when he jumps on you -> Q under yourself to make space -> Land E
   - Jax's model places him "in" you, so if you E forwards immediately it won't connect
   - Also be careful that he can jump over your Q and then trade
- If he jumps on you with E, buffer it with your E -> Q -> PTA trade and you win. 
   - You can also just E if you can make a tiny bit of space between you guys, usually you have to E backwards/to the side.
- If he jumps on you without using E, Q -> PTA trade, and hold your E
- You can look to all in from 70% HP if you buffer his E, Ignite + R kills him easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Jax's will know you want to Buffer E into his counterstrike (E), and will try to sidestep in their E animation
- When Jax has passive + grasp stacks up, you have to respect. 
- Keep in mind Jax's minions when he walks up with E. They'll try to bait your E, then Q to their minion out of range
- Spacing is super important in this lane, don't let him W + Grasp trade with you for free. 
   - You need an HP advantage pre-9 to trade, or else he can just all in you before you can kill. 
- If he manages to stun you while you flip him, be careful in buffering your R, as he can jump away to dodge it once you're both unstunned

TIPS
- You have kill potential at every point during this lane as long as you're not in the long lane.
- Ignite really helps in this lane as it goes thru his counterstrike (E) 
- You outscale at 9/Black Cleaver for the rest of the game

- Look to fight Jayce level 1, if you manage to Flip him it makes the lane significantly easier
- Most Jayce's start E or Q, try to push them into the brush and ignite early for vision. 
- If you can Flip/chunk Jayce, level 2 prio -> E + Flash is an easy solokill

HOW TO TRADE
- When facing Jayce:
   - Stay behind minions to dodge his ranged Q
   - Use the brush/respect his auto range to not let him get free autos off
- Just look for small Q + PTA/Leg trades if he enters your range. Use your Q slow to push him off if he's trying to auto you a lot
- If he fucks up his spacing you can even look to Q -> E combo, but be careful of doing this if he's full HP, or you don't have Ult/Ignite. Jayce does a lot of damage if you can't finish him off instantly
- You usually will never have the range to normal E Jayce. Only if he melee Qs into you can you look to E
- Jayce MS gate (ranged E) and knockback (melee E) give him insane self-peel, it's really easy for him to kite you. Missing E/Q can lead to a really bad trade
- With Ignite and early AD items, you one shot Jayce from ~75%HP with E + Flash. Can give CS to avoid taking poke until he's in kill range
   - Because of Jayce's oppressive poke, it's important to look to one-shot before he can slowly poke you down
- When he transforms from Melee -> Ranged, this is a good window to look to all-in as he can't melee E (knockback) for a couple seconds
- You can buffer E into Jayce E, but you have to predict it as it roots you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Jayce's main poke tool is his QE from range, try to walk in random directions when you don't have a minion wave to cover you (like when you're CS'ing under tower)
- Jayce will often look to melee Q your minions, and hit you with the AOE damage. Be respectful of the melee Q radius if you stand too close to your wave
- Jayce has built in mana refund, and sustain with Dblade/biscuits, so his resources are deceptively high

TIPS
- Jayce is a really annoying lane bully, and the better the Jayce the more annoying. I've tried many setups into Jayce like Plated Steepcaps rush + play passive, but I think the best strategy is GIGA AGGRO level 1, and build Dirk/Pickaxe/Long Swords and try to just E + Flash + Ignite instantly. 
   - Cheesing Jayce early is so important, as he has 6 abilities at level 3 and you can no longer trade favorably
   - Playing slow is also just hard vs good Jayces, they can space your Q/E too easily and he has such insane poke
- Playing for level 6 spike (you get an ult, he doesn't) is a good strategy
- You beat Jayce at 9/Black Cleaver and outscale 1v1 and in teamfights the rest of the game'

EARLY GAME
- If Kalista facechecks you in a brush early, you can fight, but generally respect and give her range. Her hop is too OP at kiting level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- It's pretty impossible to trade with Kalista, if she doesn't walk into your E range early game focus on giving cs and PRESERVING HP
- If you can predict Q into her hop, look for a small Q + PTA leg trade
   - This chunk can set her up to be killed at level 2/3 with E + Flash + Ignite
- If she's full HP, just focus on not taking too much poke and hitting Q/Legs when you can, don't overforce trades.
- If you haven't found a lead early game, rush Dirk/AD Items and try to one shot at 6 from ~80%HP with E + Flash + R + Ignite
- Kalista usually perma pushes and is very vulnerable to ganks. If you can't find leads 1v1, just make sure you save Flash for jungle ganks
- Never E at her in front of her, only E + Flash. She's too high range to ever hit a normal E 
    - Very important to not lose Flash as you need it to exist in the lane

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Care for her Q poke + E resetting on minions to chain slow/auto you poke
- Pay attention to her "hop rythm", if she keeps dashing in one direction look to predict poke with Q where she hops

TIPS
- It's a hard lane, but a very uncommon pick. Only really insane Kalista players can pilot Kalista well enough to make it work.
   - It has to get a lot of kills in lane to be useful later on
   - Kalista top also griefs the enemy draft hard usually
- Kalista gets crippled by CC, so playing around your jungler and trying to make it to teamfights is a very viable strategy

- If she wastes her empowered R ability, or her shield, you can look for a small Q + PTA trade to chunk her. 
- Generally, I don't look to interact much in this matchup. Conserve HP, play for a Dirk/Pickaxe first base
   - Then at 6, I look to E + Flash + Ignite + R  oneshot after she uses R+Q to poke

- If you chunked her enough level 1, you can look for a dive on the 2nd/3rd wave as you crash into tower.
   - If not, play to setup a freeze/gank angle as the wave then bounces back into you. 
      - Kayle is so weak at this point in the game that you can just walk behind the wave and zone her/fight her 1v1, denying her even more EXP

HOW TO TRADE
- Denying Kayle pre-6 is really important for how trades play out in this lane post-6
- Always look to Q -> E pre-6 Kayle, but focus on not hitting the wave too much. 
   - You want the wave to be pushing into you so you can deny/zone off EXP and setup ganks, which is more important than the trades
   - If you deny enough EXP, you can freeze the wave when you're 6 to her 5, which is huge
- Once Kayle hits 6, it's much harder to hit Q. Still look for Q + PTA/leg trades if you can, but they're rare, especially if she rushes T2 boots
- You can still E + Flash on Kayle post-6 if you have Ignite + AD items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kayle R can block your R2 pull, and in general they will R as you E + Flash to deny burst
   - If you E + Flash, try to see if she insta ults before immediately W'ing + R. If she does, hold off a bit on your burst until it times out.
- Watch out for Kayle's Q thru the minions, and E poke. The damage from these add up
- T2 boots + max passive stacks (gives MS) + W MS make her extremely fast in lane, don't disrespect and miss your E

TIPS
- If you can't find leads in this lane pre-6, don't overforce until level 9. It feels bad, but Kayle will bully you until you get 9/Black Cleaver, so just focus on going even until that spike again
- Kayle outscales you again around 3 items/level 16, so try to close it out early. Her R is a very powerful tool to deny your R

- Look to get behind Kennen and trade level 1. They usually start the movement speed ability (E), so try to predict where he will be when you flip
- If he respects your cheese, you can try to trade autos + Legs + PTA by just E'ing forwards to gapclose
- Should get prio for level 2 if played right

HOW TO TRADE
- The main ability to watch out for is his shuriken (Q). Stand behind minions to dodge it, and look for Q + PTA/Leg trades if he gets in range
   - Only look to Q -> Auto if you can't get hit by his Q. If you can, only Q to poke
   - Generally it's hard to look for Q as his Q outranges yours
- Repeat until he's 65%HP, then you can look to E + Flash + R one shot
   - He has really insane escape tools with his W MS and Stun, so make sure you have lethal on the Flip or he will escape fast 
- RUSH MERC TREADS. With merc treads, if he's slowed by Q, you can Q -> E combo usually even if he gets W speed and still Flip. The tenacity helps a lot too, as it lets you buffer E before you get stunned. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be mindful of his passive stacks on you (3 = stun), if he can Q -> W -> Stun, he can Q you again as you are stunned, which is too much HP to lose
- His empowered auto + W combo hurts, give CS/respect until he uses the empowered auto to CS
- Kennen is a really OP teamfighter. Try to always mark him, or ward flanks/keep track of his flash, Kennen R + Flash can insta win teamfights

TIPS
- Merc treads rush is MANDATORY in this lane, the tenacity + MS + MR are all insane stats vs Kennen

- Look to dodge his Q, then trade. Try to save your E for his dismount

- Hard outscale Kled at level 9, omega outscale as the game goes on'
2025-05-04 23:29:20,177 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E86: Details='EARLY GAME
- You can fight Kled early in a small trade, but don't extend. You don't have the damage to kill level 1, and he will get too much free courage if dismounted
- Fight as the minion wave arrives. Look to sidestep his Q and trade Autos
   - If he hits Q, E TO THE SIDE FOR THE SHIELD, and auto with legs/PTA. It's risky to flip forwards INTO HIM level 1, as he can trade autos with you, dismount with Conq stacks, and then get a lot of courage to remount before you can kill.

HOW TO TRADE
- The key to this matchup is not dismounting Kled until your E is up
   - If you start off the trade with E, don't dismount him. Don't auto attack him, just walk away to buy time for your E CD
   - If he's able to start the fight at like 30-40% courage he can almost always remount before you can kill, especially if he has his W up.
   - Once Kled is dismounted, E + Flash + W + Ignite is a guaranteed kill
- When you trade, it's important you don't dismount him without the ability to kill, or else the next fight he will remount and gain way too much HP to ever fight again
- Look to sidestep his Q, then go for Q -> PTA/Leg trades. 
   - Try to also tether at max Q range, that way even if he hits it you can walk away from it before it yoinks you (the yoink does way more damage)
- If he wastes W on a minion, you can look to trade 
- Only look to Flip Mounted Kled in this matchup if he's chunked ~60% HP, that way you can kill with R + Ignite before he remounts
- Try to R him right before he dismounts, as he gets a smaller hitbox + Q dash and is harder to hit with R
- Your E can "ride" Kled Q for a guaranteed flip (as long as he doesn't E away). 
   - This is useful when Kled looks to mounted Q you while in his dismount animation, you can ride the Q with your E -> R -> kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Kled has one of the strongest level 3's in the game, be respectful of his E -> Q -> W combo
- A lot of Kled's will not level their W until they need it to remount, don't get baited
- Be careful when you E + Flash + R when he's almost dismounted, he goes invulnerable as he dismounts, so your R can miss
- Dismounted Kled's Q is actually a buffer, good Kled's can try to counterplay your E with this
- If you R Kled as he remounts, his remount invcan deny your R2
- Kled R gives him really strong roams/ganks on mid lane, make sure to ping his location


TIPS
- Your E can buffer his R for a guaranteed flip
- Kled needs kills in lane to be useful, you OMEGA outscale Kled as the game goes on.
- Kled players rely on knowing when to remount better than you do to get kills. Don't play into this, only dismount when you have E -> R combo up for guaranteed execute'

- After he buys Chain Vest/armor, it's unplayable

- Space his Q range and buffer E into his W if he tries to go aggro

- Respect the walls, you can't E into him if his W or E is up

- PLAY AROUND PHASE RUSH, make sure it's up if he R's you

'
2025-05-04 23:29:20,178 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E89: Details='EARLY GAME
- You can look to fight K'Sante level 1, if they start Q, Auto -> E -> Auto -> Phase Rush out
   - If they start E, they won't Q you as you walk up, so try to predict their E dash with your E
- Generally don't try to overtrade level 1, K'Sante has so much regen with DShield, and you have very low kill potential, the damage won't matter much. Focus on CS'ing 

HOW TO TRADE
- You can only trade with K'Sante pre first base. Once he gets any amount of armor, any trade is negative for you. 
- You can never really go aggressive in this lane, just trying to outscale and be more useful in teamfights
- As he goes for CS, look for small Q + Leg poke. Be respectful of his Q range, and his E -> Q range as well. If Q's a minion, you can look for longer trades
- You can buffer your E into his Q3 knockup
   - Be careful with this, as they can W or E to counter your E buffer if they know about it
- Once he gets his first armor item (Chain Vest) HE IS OMEGA HITLER. He can dash (E) at you in your own wave and still win the trade. 
   - Preemptively click down to dodge his E->Q combo
- You can never E at him if he has W or E up. 
- You can buffer E into K'Sante W (make sure your E hits during the dash, not the channel). The timing on this buffer is a little tricky as he can change how long he holds W
   - This interaction makes it hard for K'Sante to ever ult you/force the all-in, as you can phase rush to safety during the stun
- Just try your best to interact minimally and keep your farm even. K'Sante is one of the few champs that can beat Urgot at 9/Black Cleaver

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always be mindful of your Phase Rush cooldown, if it's down it's really easy for K'Sante to Q -> W -> R chain slow you down, especially with Icebourne Gauntlet
- A good K'Sante can buffer his R into your W, so even if you E buffer his W, he can W -> R and cancel your E 
- If he Q3's you under your tower, you have to E AWAY FROM HIM, or else he can W-> R you over the wall
- He has no mana costs in Ult form, so don't get baited by him appearing OOM
- Watch your positioning near walls when trying to trade/gank K'Sante. Don't give him a R kidnap angle if your jungle ganks

TIPS
- Outscaling K'Sante in the 1v1 is really hard, even at 9/Black Cleaver.  His W is hard for Urgot to dodge, but he's much clunkier in teamfights and falls off hard then compared to Urgot
- His W does not immune him from your R2, it will just delay the pull until his W animation completes'

- Lee Sin looks to perma push/out sustain, hard to trade

- Look to get behind him and fight level 1, but only a small Auto -> E -> Auto PTA trade. Don't extend the trade for his Conq + 2nd Q rotation

HOW TO TRADE
- Lee Sin top looks to waveclear/poke with E, and outsustain with W. Doesn't really play for the 1v1
- Everytime he walks up look to Q -> PTA/Leg combo. Can look for E + Flash + R + Ignite all in at 6 if hes ~70%HP
   - Again, he has a lot of sustain with W and no mana costs, so don't force it unless he's taken a lot of damage
- Be careful of his E radius, he will spam it on the wave, make sure it doesn't hit you as well
- You cannot E him if he has W up + minions nearby to dash to
- If he ever Q -> Q2s you, you can E into him and chunk him hard. They usually won't do this though unless it's guaranteed lethal
- You can buffer E into Lee Sin kick (R), the timing is a little tricky though. Pay attention on ganks/trades when they make it obvious they want to kick you
   - Especially if they Q onto you while getting ganked, be ready to E backwards if he tries to ward hop -> R behind you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful of Q -> Q2 -> Ward hop mid animation to bait out your E

TIPS
- This pick isn't very common anymore, and it's rather weak. It's hard to win lane as he's very slippery and has high sustain, but you omega outscale him in the 1v1 and in teamfights.
- As long as you don't give him kills in lane, it's a useless pick

2025-05-04 23:29:20,180 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E95: Details='EARLY GAME
- Malphite is really weak level 1, look to get behind him and fight. If he does not facecheck the bush and get into E range, careful to not let him just Q you for free and run away with the MS
- If he has E start, look to Auto -> Flip -> Make space so he can't E -> Auto -> Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- If Malphite ever gets in E range, look to flip, especially if you have legs/equal items
- This is a poke lane, try your best to use TP + Cull + Dblade + Pots to stay health enough to eat farm until 9/Black Cleaver
   - Really important to save your TP to reset for when he pokes you out too hard.
- Malphite will max range Q + Comet you on repeat until you're in lethal. You can't really interact since max range Q + MS lets him kite your E
   - TAKE CONTROL OF THE BRUSHES, don't let him Q you for free. Make him work for it.
   - Early on, E for the shield + Auto + Leg whenever he walks up to Q you
   - You're playing to outsustain his mana pool
- If he has no Q, you can look to Q->PTA/Leg trade, or even Q->E Flip. Careful if you flip pre-9, Malphite in the long lane with armor (Warden's Mail, etc) can run you down and kill you
- Once you break his shield, try to hit him with autos to keep it ticking. Be careful of overusing mana in this lane, as you can't really kill.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Malphite is really hard to kill after his first base for armor. Try to get as much of a lead as you can before then.
- Malphite is really strong level 6+ with an Armor Component, don't ego and just focus on keeping your farm up
- If Malphite rushes Thornmail, it's really hard to win 1v1, even at Black Cleaver. Pray you have AP Carries and play to eat farm + teamfight, not 1v1

TIPS
- Level 1-2, Malphite Q costs a ton of mana and only is worth for him if he has Comet + Manaflowbind up. Stand in front of him and try to baitt him to Q you when those are down 
- If Malphite goes grasp, it's a free win. If they have to actually auto/enter your E range, you can hard win trades
- Don't toggle at level 9+ if he has E attack speed slow on you
- It's hard to kill Malphite, but it's hard for Malphite to kill you, and you outscale 1v1 at 9/Black Cleaver. In teamfights, as long as you have some magic damage, you're more useful
- His ult cannot immune Urgot R2, it will execute him after the animation

- Look to get behind Maokai and trade hard, buffer his Q with your E if you can get close enough. 
- Try to deny the first 3 EXP or CS, you should always get prio for level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Maokai is short range, just play around his Smash (Q). 
- Wiggle around his max Q range, it's a bit longer than your auto range. Look for Q->PTA/Leg trade if he misses/uses Q
   - Usually Maokai CS'es with Q, so look for trades everytime he does so. USE YOUR RANGE
- You can look to Q->E combo Maokai and buffer his E through his Q. Make sure close the gap as much as possible before Eing, it makes it easier to buffer E
- If he ever Roots (W) you, E BEHIND YOURSELF to Flip him after he becomes targetable again
- Don't let him get free Grasp + passive autos and free Q poke on you, and he has no tools to fight back. 
   - Deny him CS and outscale


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Maokai W can dodge your E and your R, be careful E'ing Maokai normally. 
   - If his W is up, E + Flash or look to BUFFER E THROUGH HIS Q
   - Also do not R Maokai unless he's E stunned, or wait for him to get out of range so he has no W targets
- Maokai has really nice gank setup, get vision out after you crash waves to not die to jungle
- From 7-9, Maokai (with 4 points Q) with armor items/bami is actually strong, respect until 9

TIPS
- This is a relatively easy tank lane, he has a lot less laning pressure than most tanks but better scaling. 
- You hard outscale at 9/Black Cleaver, and decisively win 1v1 the rest of the game. However, his teamfight power is better than yours so really look to establish AT LEAST a CS lead in lane
- Try to play side lane vs Maokai later on as he wants to only teamfight

2025-05-04 23:29:20,183 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E101: Details='EARLY GAME
- If you have Ignite, you can look to fight Mordekaiser early. 
- However, Mordekaiser lvl 1 is no joke. You have to get the jump on him Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA, and kite with your legs. 
   - His passive + Conq + 2nd Q cast can make it a close fight
- Usually, just look to E thru the first 3 melees and FLIP Mordekaiser as he Qs them -> Auto Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage 
   - If you can Flip him here into a chunk, it's huge for your lane
- Should get level 2 prio 

HOW TO TRADE
- After the first 3 levels, Mordekaiser stat checks you until 9/Black Cleaver
- Your goal is to not contest/play aggro unless he's ~60% HP and in oneshot E + Flash + Ignite + R range. 
   - Look for small Q/Leg poke, but do not E forwards or play too aggro when he's higher HP.
   - His shield + Conq makes him really tanky after your E burst, you usually can't kill and then he ramps up and kills you
- Play around his Q, wiggle around its range and try to bait it out. 
   - If he uses/misses Q, look for a short Q->PTA/leg trade. 
- If he ever wastes shield (W) you can look to heavy trade/all-in if hes ~70%HP
- If he holds shield (W), hold your E in all-ins until hes around ~40% HP so you can burst him below execute 25% range during your E stun. 
   - Even if he shields after, your R will still execute him
- If he ever E's you and you can't dodge it, buffer E away 
   - You can "ride" his scoop (E) with your E, useful in flipping him under tower if he doesn't know

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL IN THE LONG LANE. Mordekaiser can just walk up -> R -> EQ  and force the all in from Full HP. Even if he can't kill you, you will lose way too much HP
- Mordekaiser shield (W) makes him deceptively tanky, be patient with your R after you Flip as he can time it out easily
- Use your Flash to dodge one of his Qs if he all-ins you
- Be careful of him using his Ult to trap you and setup a jungle gank

TIPS
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you, you literally can't fight pre-9 if he's equal pre-9
   - If the wave is pushing away from you, STAND ON YOUR MINIONS and bait him to Q you to push it back
- You can actually complete your R2 as he ults, you can yoink him out of his death realm (R)
- Really difficult lane, but it's Urgot favored at 9/Black Cleaver if you play the fight well. After level 13 and 2 items you hard outscale Mordekaiser for the rest of the game.
   - Mordekaiser is also not a great champ, he's really weak to ranged/kiting. If you fall behind, don't worry if your comp isn't 4+ melees.'

2025-05-04 23:29:20,185 - urgot_matchup_helper - DEBUG -   E104: Details='EARLY GAME
- Look to get behind Nasus and fight level 1, ZONE HIM OFF THE FIRST 3 MELEE EXP. 
- If he walks up past you, try to flip him back towards his tower and PTA chunk for 70% of his HP
- If you chunked hard, look for E + Flash + W + Ignite kill at level 2. If there is no angle, look to freeze/setup a gank after the wave crashes then bounces back
   - As it bounces back, you can walk behind the wave (make sure you don't have minion aggro) and fight/zone off Nasus again
- Trading/deny EXP level 1 is critical in this lane, or else you can't punish Nasus pre-6.  You want to either take his HP and TP, or make him lose EXP.
   - Once he hits 6 the matchup gets really hard in an isolated 1v1 without a lead.

HOW TO TRADE
- Pre-6, if Nasus ever walks up, look to Q->E->Trade as hard as possible. 
- After 6, only look to Flip if hes ~60%HP and you have Ignite/items. His R is an insanely powerful 1v1 tool
   - Just look for Q->Leg/PTA trades until he's low enough to all-in
- Usually Nasus goes 3/4 points E with Dring/Tear, and just stands 10 screens back wave clearing.
   - Not much counterplay to this strat, do your best to dodge the E (impossible challenge)
   - MAKE HIM CHOOSE BETWEEN E'ING YOU OR THE WAVE: Stand on the side of the lane, and look to Q->Trade if he E's the wave
   - Preserve your HP vs this setup: don't overly force the freeze if your jungle isn't nearby
   - His stacks are low with this setup, but he can get CS/EXP. 
- If you haven't found a lead pre-6, play to just farm up until 9/Black Cleaver when you beat Nasus again.
   - Even if you found a lead, you can still easily lose at Nasus 6 + Sheen, focus on growing your CS lead, or chunking him out hard if you want to all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If Nasus runs Phase Rush, respect the cooldown before looking to all-in/R, as it also gives slow resist after
- Nasus R gives him lots of Resists + HP, so don't R too early or it will time out
- His wither (W) slow is really strong at setting up ganks, don't overextend looking too hard to trade

TIPS
- Don't toggle W if you are withered, just leave W on
- You are slightly favored at 9/Black Cleaver, but eventually in the 1v1 he outscales depending on his stacks.
   - But your teamfight is much better than his due to Urgot's CC, just focus on E/Ring him when your team can focus him down

- You can really fight Neeko level 1 if she facechecks/gets near the bush
- If she has Q start, you can look to Auto -> E to gap close/shield -> Auto Auto PTA then disengage for a nice chunk 
- If she has clone (W) start, it's a little trickier as she can run out of your auto range. If she starts Dblade, she will usually start clone (W). You can still fight tho, just try to hold your E to bait out her W first
- If you can't trade level 1, focus on using brushes to avoid autos and match her push as best you can

HOW TO TRADE
- Neeko's high range/poke makes this matchup hard, you can only poke with Q
- Do your best to avoid her Q/E/Empowered W Auto
   - If she misses/uses E, you can look for a Q->PTA/Leg trade
   - If she has E up, try to dodge her Q and look for Q poke in return
   - Stand in brushes/respect when has empowered W auto up
- If you can poke her down enough, look for E + Flash + R + Ignite one shot
- I like to go early Dirk/AD items + Ignite in this matchup so I can flash her from high HP. Playing slow lets her poke you down too much, her Q is really hard to dodge
- If you're fast with E + Flash, you will still Flip her even if she clones as you Flip
- If you Flash to kill, make sure you have lethal. Her Clone + E + R can time out/disengage easily, and without Flash you can't play the game for 5 minutes

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful overextending a trade, as her W clone + MS can outrange you easily
- Neeko W can bodyblock your R and E

TIPS
- Count the minions to see if she's invisible, press tab and if her portrait lights up but you don't see her, she's disguised somewhere
- Always remember that if you "see" the enemy jungle on minimap, it could be Neeko. Don't think you're safe from jungle ganks.
- You can buffer E through her E and R
- You hard outscale AP Neeko in the 1v1, but AD/on-hit Neeko is a little more tricky. If you don't have a lead, be respectful of AD Neeko's damage/scaling, but you're much more useful in teamfights '

- Level 1 look to fight him before minions spawn, BUT DO NOT FIGHT PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE
   - Auto -> Try to get behind him and E him towards his tower -> Auto -> Phase Rush and disengage
   - If you look for anything more, he can ghost/Q chain slow you and win, as his Ghost lasts longer than Phase Rush
- If you don't fight before minions arrive, look to E Flip him as he CS'es the first 3 and Phase Rush away
- You should always get level 2 prio. Trading hard level 1 sets up a level 2 E + Flash + W + Ignite kill, which makes this lane A LOT easier

HOW TO TRADE
- You are actually stronger in this matchup pre-6, but once Olaf hits 6 NEVER INTERACT UNTIL 9/Black Cleaver
- Pre-6, look to use your range and Q+Legs to trade hard. 
   - Don't commit your E unless he's low enough to burst in W with Ignite, he gets too much lifesteal + shielding at low HP
   - If he's ~30-40% HP, and you have Ignite + Legs up, you can look to commit to an all-in 
- If Olaf has Ghost/TP, play for prio and call your jungler to gank when the wave bounces back. He has no counterplay to your E + Flash, and then you get his TP on a frozen wave
   - If Olaf has Ghost/Flash, can do the same play, they usually won't react to E + Flash. 
      - Look to kill, or at least chunk and force him to base on a frozen wave with no TP
      - Be a little careful, as if you Flash too early and he's not low enough, he can trade 1 for 1
- If he throws his axe (Q) too far away, look for a Q->Leg trade, he has no all-in threat if he can't pick up his axe
- Post-6, always look to hold the wave and freeze. Be careful when the wave is pushing out. OLAF WANTS THE LONG LANE TO GHOST/Q YOU DOWN IN AN ALL-IN
   - If the wave starts pushing out, stand in your minions and bait him to Q so it pushes back to you
   - Never walk into his Q range unless you have PHASE RUSH up
- Most Olafs will panic R when you R them if they're in execute hp. 
   - Hold your R2, Olafs ult will time out and then you can R2 him in for the execute
- Try to bait him to all in you, then use Phase Rush/E to disengage. He is much weaker without his Ult than you post-9
- You can win at level 9/Black Cleaver vs Olaf if you have Ignite + get the first jump on him, but you will lose if he can instantly melee range/fight you. 
   - Use your range + Phase Rush movement speed to space him

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Olaf R prevents you from E'ing or R executing him, which is why this matchup is hard
- He gets increased lifesteal/shielding when low, you NEED ANTI-HEAL (Ignite or item) to kill at any point in the game
- His ult lasts for as long as he can auto, so try to disengage ASAP to let it time out
- It's often not worth to get your jungler to gank Olaf until 9/Black Cleaver, you don't have any damage/CC thru his R and he can 1v2 easily


TIPS
- You can use Ignite for Nimbus Cloak MS as another disengage tool if your Phase Rush is down
- Olaf R costs 100 mana, so he runs into a lot of mana issues nowdays if he spams axe (Q). If he has <100 mana, can look to E + Flash + R even when he's 6
- You CAN win past 9 if played well, but it's still a 50-50. Unless you're ahead, Olaf's 1v1 is always strong vs Urgot, but his teamfighting is much worse usually.
   - Focus on getting through lane even, then being more useful in 5v5s'

- Look to fight Ornn level 1 with Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA disengage. 
- Ornn doesn't really take a lot of damage, so focus on CSing over trading in this lane after the level 1

HOW TO TRADE
- Interacting with Ornn before 9/Black Cleaver is always negative. We can never flip forwards in this lane, just farm up and outscale
   - His ability to build items in lane means you have to preserve your TP and TAKE RESETS WHEN YOU CAN
   - He only takes damage before he buys, once he has any armor component/bamis he is exodia
- His Q is his main poke ability + sets up larger trades with Q->E. Focus on dodging the Q damage and move away from the pillar immediately
   - Ornn's will usually throw Q to CS, so don't stack on top of your minions
- If Ornn ever looks to Q->E combo you, be ready to buffer E away to deny an extended trade from him
- Ornn breath (W) will deny your Flip, but HE WILL STILL BE STUNNED AFTER. If you E -> Ornn Ws, insta click away while he's stunned so he can't brittle auto you
- If you do have to fight, try to walk behind him as he W's to avoid the Brittle
- If he does waste his Q, W, or E, you can look for Q->PTA/Leg trades before he can W you

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Always look to stop him from building for free when you can by hitting him. Try to make him choose between building really far away and giving CS/EXP.
   - Some Ornn's will fake build in your face to bait you into Q->E range, or to waste your mana. 
   - Sometimes just standing close to Ornn without hitting/Qing is enough to stop his build
- Ornn's triple brittle combo with Ult legit can oneshot you from 80%HP if you're overextended. Do not disrespect Ornn's damage post-6
- You can buffer E into Ornn's Brittle auto knockback, but the timing is tricky. If you E too early he can knockdown your E with the auto
- If you have Brittle on you, if you're on top of Ornn's Q as it spawns, it will literally push you and consume the Brittle proc for damage


TIPS
- When Ornn summons his R, look to E or E + Flash before he gets it off, if they W they can't recast R2
- Ornn W will not deny your R2, it will execute after his W animation
- After level 9, Most Ornn's will use their E to run away. If you're fast enough, you can Q->E and grab him out of his E since it has an animation delay
- You hard outscale Ornn after 9/Black Cleaver as you can take extended trades now, and you outscale 1v1 for the rest of the game. He does bring equal teamfight value though, so if you can play sidelane it's better

   - REALLY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T OVERAGGRO LEVEL 1 AND LOSE FREE HP TO PANTH Q, ITS TOO HIGH RANGE/LOW CD TO OUTPLAY

HOW TO TRADE
- You can't really force trades if he has Q, it outranges you. Try to wiggle at his Q range, and if you dodge it look for a Q->PTA/Leg combo.
   - This lane just comes down to respecting his Q poke and range until you outscale.
- You can buffer E into his W, just be on the look out for it as it comes fast
   - Pre-9 however you don't want to E forwards unless hes ~60-70% HP, as he can kill you with Conq + Q + Ignite 
   - Post-9, if you E his W you insta kill him
- Just play slow and look to small trade with Q/Legs while dodging his Qs. If he wastes E, or he's <60%HP you can look to one shot with E + Flash + Ignite + R
- His E CAN Block your R2, and a lot of your E + Flash damage, but usually they will E the wrong way.
   - If they E towards you -> You E Flip them -> you can deal damage as they're E'ing the wrong way now
- If you look to Flip -> all-in with R, only press R once so you can wait for his E to expire

- Spam ping if he goes MIA, his R is a strong ganking tool on mid lane
- His Q is actually really hard to dodge front-to-back, it's long. If you have to walk into his Q range, try dodging side to side

TIPS
- Pantheon is strong level 1-5, but falls off around level 6f as you get a combat ult and he doesn't. 
- He gets hard outscaled by level 9/Black Cleaver and is way weaker in 1v1s/teamfiights for the rest of the game.

HOW TO TRADE
- Play slow in this lane, use your range + autos to do work, if she can hit you back with Q+ Passive it's losing
- When she has her buckler (Passive up), stay in bush/give CS until she consumes it. Earlier in the game you can E just to shield the damage -> Auto + Leg
- You can never E Poppy when she has her circle (W) up, but it does have a higher CD than your E
   - Against worse players, you can look to test their reactions on W level 1-3. Sometimes they won't press it, especially if you're a little closer to them
- BE TIGHT WITH YOUR SPACING. Poppy Q is about the same range as your auto, very slightly shorter 
   - When she walks up, Q->Leg/PTA trade, but be sure to use max range auto so she can't Q you
- If she's ~60% HP or wastes W, you can look for E + Flash + R kill. 
   - The best Poppys can W your E + Flash, so be respectful depending on your Elo
- If you can kill, lead with R -> They will channel R -> Buffer Poppy R with your E -> Kill

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Good Poppys will use their E on minions as a gapcloser/escape
   - Be careful of Poppy E'ing a minion -> right on top of you for Q -> you can't E because she has W
   - Also be careful of E + Flashing when she has a minion to E to for escape
- Always pay attention to how close you are to walls for her E, she does too much damage if she gets the stun off. 
   - The upper walls of top lane are closer than they seem
- Without flash up, you can't live a gank vs Poppy + Jungler as you can't E away and she can perma slow you

TIPS
- You can buffer Poppy E and R with your E. Both are tricky timings, especially the E
   - You need fast reactions for Poppy E bufer. Whenever you walk near a wall, just hover your E button. You will still get stunned, but you'll also Flip + Stun Poppy
   - Poppy R is a little easier, give some space so you can react
- YOU CAN FLIP (E) POPPY WITH HER CIRCLE (W) ON, IF YOU ARE ON TOP OF HER MODEL. 
   - If you are that close, it will insta flip, so it's not considered a dash, but you have to be RIGHT ON HER MODEL.
   - If she E+W,  you can buffer E into her E and W won't knock you down as you are close enough
- Recasting R2 will cancel knockbacks, so if Poppy has R'ed you while you R2 execute someone, it will put you back on the ground

   - They usually Auto -> E, so try to time it after the first Auto
   - If you buffer successfully she literally just dies level 1
- If you can't, just try to take brush and match her push. Don't take too many free autos.

HOW TO TRADE
- Quinn is really weak to Urgot E as it puts her behind Urgot, so she can't E away like normal
- Stand behind minions to dodge her blind (Q) and Q poke until shes 75% HP, then look for E + Flash + R + Ignite oneshot
   - Only go for auto attacks if her Q/E is down
- Buffering E into Quinn E is always a guaranteed kill, but a really hard timing to get down as Quinn E comes out FAST.
   - They usually E after an empowered auto, so look to E around that timing
- If she's even slightly chunked (2-3 Qs), you can one shot at 6 with Ignite + Dirk/AD Components. Don't be afraid to just E + Flash
- It's important you don't waste your E, as she can take all your HP running you down with her MS + Passive autos

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR

   - For some real mindgames, if they do this, you can buffer E as soon as you Q, that way if they E to dodge your Q you Flip them
- Her level 6 is really annoying for just roaming, make sure to spam your mid/jungle to be careful
- Keep her W vision reveal in mind when trying to cheese, I like to stand in the Alcove or really far back so she can't spot me

TIPS
- If you E + Flash Quinn, make sure to keep kiting towards her tower so she can't E to safety
- If you get a lead on Quinn, it's really hard for her to play 1v1, and you one shot her with E the entire game. She will just try to roam around the map, so make sure you punish if she does'

- If he has W on, only auto attack him if you have a leg up
- Look to trade and bait ous his W. Wait for his W to expire before dumping Q + PTA + W on him. 
   - If he takes enough damage with W down, you can kill with R
- Just use your range + autos whenever you can, try not to commit too much mana as he's hard to kill
- It's actually not that bad of a matchup because he has no kill pressure, just annoying. Just farm up and scale
- If you can flip him in front of tower with W on, you can kill him as he will get aggro

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- MAKE SURE YOU TURN W OFF BEFORE HE TAUNTS (E) YOU. You will insta die as each of your W ticks make you take full damage from his W + Thornmail
- His R is a pretty fast dash, so be patient with your R or wait for your E stun
- They usually look for the proxy, try to ward the river so you can see if he tries to. If you have an AP Jungler you can easily kill him.

TIPS
- Rammus is an easy lane, but even if he's 0-10 he will be UNKILLABLE if you don't have consistent AP damage (Azir good, Nidalee bad)

- If Rek'Sai tries to knock you up (W) first, you can buffer E and flip her. Be prepared for this if she tunnels (E) at you
- Realistically save E for E + Flash when she's around 50% HP.
   - She has to be lower than usual because she can time out your R with her R animation

- Care if he has high fury, if he doesn't you can Q->PTA trade

- Buffer your E when he E->W combos you

- Respect Renek's diving ability with jungler

- Outscale at 9, omega outscale rest of game

- You're only stronger than Renekton in lane at level 1, so look to get behind him and fight
- If he starts Q, you can just Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA trade heavily. 
- Usually they start E, so Auto -> E backwards to try to predict his E through you. Even if you can't catch him with E, the free autos is still decent
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Renekton's has good short trades, good long trades (Conq + R), and high sustain (Q). He is a lane bully, so our primary goal should be to go even until 9/Black Cleaver
- Pay attention to his fury. If he has low fury, you can play aggressive with Q + PTA/Leg trades when he steps up. If he has high fury you have to respect
- Be tight with your spacing, try to get Q/Auto poke while avoiding his Q
- Buffering E into Renekton stun (W) is a good window to trade, they look to E->W (buffer E before they can E out)
   - HOWEVER, don't E forwards in the long lane if he's level 6 and now <60%HP, as his Ult + Conq can run you down
- Good Renketons will mix up his trading pattern, E-> Q -> E is hard to react to, just try to space his initial E
- Don't try to over trade in this lane, he has a lot of sustain, no mana, and stronger trades.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Renekton is amazing at setting up dives, when he's slow pushing large waves into you DO NOT TRADE AND PRESERVE YOUR HP, especially if they have Nidalee/Elise/etc jungle

TIPS
- You outscale Renekton at 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game. He is a early/mid game lane bully, so focus on farm and going even
- If their team has lots of healing, early anti-heal is not bad'

- His empowered W can cleanse your E and R2

- Stay away/ward bushes and let him push you in, just play to scale Rengar is rather useless outside of lane

- Rengar is really weak if you can perma push him in, he can't uses bushes then

- You can win after 6 because you get a combat ult

- Level 1 run straight to the middle bush in lane. If Rengar enters, you can look to fight hard with Ignite
- If he doesn't facecheck, keep control of the brushes, and use your ward to keep vision as you go to CS
- Should get level 2 prio


HOW TO TRADE
- Rengar's W makes every trade winning for him before you have antiheal, game plan is to keep bushes warded and stand on the far side so he can't jump you
- AVOID FIGHTING NEAR BUSHES. Look to just play slow and scale up, if he gives you angles to poke take them and you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot if hes <60% HP.
   - Just make sure he has low ferocity stacks, as he can Empowered W your R2
- RUSH ANTIHEAL. Once you get antiheal you can take more aggressive trades, look for Q -> PTA/Leg trade after he jumps to CS a minion. 
   - You can even try to predict E as he jumps

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Rengar Empowered W can cleanse your Flip, stun, AND R2. Make sure to keep track of his ferocity when R/E'ing
- If you ward the brush and rengar sees it, he can insta oneshot it with Q. Make sure when you ward the brush he doesn't see it
- Spam ping when he goes MIA, his Ult is great at ganking your jungle/mid
- Leaping from brush at 0 ferocity gives him a stack, so be careful of his empowered cast in one spell rotation from brush

TIPS
- ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP THE BRUSH NEAREST YOUR TOWER WARDED. 
   - Then you don't have to be afraid of his bush cheese as the wave bounces back to him
- Rengar can't play when he's pushed in or frozen on, as he can't use the bushes to fight. 
- Keep the early game stable, that's his only window to cheese you. Once you're level 9, you hard statcheck Rengar, he can never jump you, and just keep him perma pushed in so he can't do anything

- Control the lane with your range + Q, make her use her Q to gapclose instead of for damage

- If you miss E you die, be patient or E + Flash

- You win at every point and outscale, but Riven can outplay with Flash

- You can fight Riven level 1, but if they have Conq + Ignite, disengage after Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA
   - Their Q will come up before they die, and they can flash on you QQQ and kill you
- Ideally wait for minions to crash, then look to E flip + PTA while they Q to CS the first 3, then kite back to your own minion wave
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- SPACING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, always keep Riven at max range and use your Q + Autos + Legs to poke her down
   - If she Q's forwards, look for a Q -> PTA/Leg trade to deter her from coming closer with Q
   - Make her have to use E + Q1 to gapclose if she wants to trade, if she can Q early for damage it's hard
- This lane is based around her shield (E) CD. If it's up you have to respect and can't commit your E
- Look to Flip (E) on her stun (W) or Q3.
   - Q3 is riskier to E at, as it's higher range, and she can E away before your E connects, Don't recommend E'ing Riven's Q3 unless they're noobs
   - Better Rivens will look to E forwards -> W -> Auto -> Q out. Be prepared to flip during E->W, you will kill if you do this, but the timing is hard
- Repeat trades until shes 60-70%HP. If she wastes her E, you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R kill
- A good Riven will be hard to kill, so just focus on applying pressure with your auto + Q range. Build a CS lead and outscale.

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- BE CAREFUL TO NOT LET HER BAIT YOUR E, IF YOU MISS E YOU DIE. 
- Riven is one of the best proxy champs, don't let her as she can easily kill your Jungler. Try to put vision in river and watch her if she tries to go around
- Do not underestimate Conq + Ignite + Level 6 Riven, she can kill you from 80%HP

TIPS
- This matchup is generally good for Urgot as he wins early + outscales, but Riven can definitely outplay at 6 with Ignite.  
   - If you fight anywhere not near your tower, be careful that she can just flash your E if you all-in (even from full HP)
- The longer the game goes the harder you outscale.  Hitting E on Riven in teamfights = instakill.
- CC absolutely fucks Riven, if you can pair Urgot with any CC jungler (Vi, Taliyah, etc) she cannot play'

- Be careful trading autos when he's overheated after you E, he hurts

- You can look to trade with Rumble level 1 if you get behind him, they usually start E
- If he respects the cheese and doesn't check the bush, don't try to overforce. The E slow + damage is too hard to outplay
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- It's really hard to trade with Rumble after level 2-3, since his flamethrower (Q), W MS, and E slow let him space you easily. Give CS and preserve your HP.
- Try to always keep the wave pushing into you. If he tries to Q you, stand your ground in your wave with Q + PTA/Legs. 
   - If you fight back, Rumble will click away meaning his Q won't be hitting you for a little
- Try your hardest to not fall behind. If you can't stand your ground in your wave, he can run behind your wave and Q->E you without consequences
- It's hard to play slow in this matchup, as he will just poke you down. Try to trade hard early game, then look to E + Flash + W + Ignite at level 2-3 for a kill
   - Even if you chunk + trade flashes, it's still fine
- If he ever wastes W, look for a Q + PTA/Leg trade, or even an all-in if he's low enough
- At level 6, you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill if hes ~70%HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he's near OVERHEAT, if you look to E + Flash and don't kill him in the Stun, his overheat autos HURT
- Dodge his E's, if he can hit both on you they shred a lot of MR and you get oneshot
- Rumble Q and E DO NOT DRAW MINION AGGRO, so don't feel too safe in a big wave.

TIPS
- It's quite hard to dodge Rumble E due to your large hitbox, standing behind minions is your best bet 
- If you Flip Rumble in Q, his Q will not face you, you can reduce some damage in the all-in this way
- If you fall behind/struggle, sitting on a Negatron Cloak isn't bad
- You outscale Rumble at 9/Black Cleaver if not behind, and demolish him as the game goes on in 1v1/teamfights. Going down 20CS in this lane is fine, just focus on getting EXP and not dying'

- Play for level 2 prio, should get it
- If he's chunked enough, look to E + Flash + W level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- Ryze outranges you and has strong poke, as well as strong disengage with W + Phase Rush
- Stand behind minions and look for Q poke. 
   - If he has no angle to bounce/hit Q on you, can extend Q->PTA/Leg trade
- If he gives range, Look to Q->E gapclose 
   - When you get near with Q slow + Approach Velocity MS, most Ryze's will try to root
   - BUFFER E THROUGH RYZE ROOT to hard win the trade. It's the same range as your E so if you E as soon as you're in range to flip, it will go thru usually
- Repeat until he's ~60%HP, then you can look for E + Flash + R lethal
- Lane is tricky, especially because Ryze goes HP in Catalyst/ROA so he's hard to oneshot
- Don't overforce, if you take too much poke it's hard to play the all-in

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Respect his ability to kite you with Phase Rush, W slow, and range.
- Be careful of standing too close to minions, Ryze can E->Q chain off the minions to hit you
- If you look to E + Flash + R, be aware that you only have 2s to kill with R, as he will Ult out himself

TIPS
- Merc Treads rush helps a ton in landing E. 
- Ryze scales really well, harder than Urgot, but post 9 (and especially if you get movement speed items like Youmuu's) you one shot him 1v1. 
- As long as you can get on top of Ryze and Flip, you win.'

HOW TO TRADE
- Play around her W, it's her main damage ability. If she uses it, kite side to side to dodge it
   - When it's on cooldown look for Q->PTA/Leg trade
- You can Buffer her Dash (Q) with E, they usually don't Q in but be ready to Flip if she does
- Be ready to buffer E away from her R or stun (E). She has really low kill threat in lane but sets up ganks extremely well
- Maintain your spacing, and play to punish her on every CS with Q/Autos. As long as you don't eat too many Ws, she can't do much and you outscale

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E at her first, she can knock it down with Q.
- Her burst damage with R + Ignite + her full combo does a lot of damage, don't disrespect if you're ~60%HP

- Be careful in fighting Sett level 1, he's strong with W + Conq. 
- As the minions crash, auto him once. If you see his Grit stack, disengage (he has W) and just play for push, small chip autos.
- If it doesn't, he has E and you can look to Auto -> Flip -> Auto Auto PTA. 
   - Try to buffer E through his E
- You should always get level 2 prio as long as you don't give him a big W charge

HOW TO TRADE
- Don't let him stack W. Look for small Q + PTA trades, then insta disengage before he can E->W you.
   - If he Ws, you will have enough range to dodge the center by moving side to side
- Sett has long CDs, but it's hard to make him use them unfavorably. Just farming and outscaling in this matchup is good
   - Of course if he does waste his W, you can look to take a big trade. 
- Never E forwards aggressively until 9/Black Cleaver unless he's chunked. He has really good extended trades with Conq + W
- If he tries to Q for MS -> E you to force trades, be ready to buffer E away. If you can do this, he can't ever force trades on you. 
- If hes ~40-50% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R one shot before he can W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- He has really high sustain when he gets low, if you don't have Ignite, don't overforce trying to kill him without E unless you have R to execute
- Sett R cancels your E completely, so be careful E'ing around him.
- Also be careful when E'ing forwards in lane, as he can ult you back into his tower/side of the map to extend the trade

TIPS
- You can actually flip Sett as he W's behind you, so that his W completely misses. However this is risky as the timing has to be clean, and if he combos E->W it could mess it up
- You are stronger at 9/Black Cleaver, but nothing too crazy. As the game goes on you destroy him, especially if you can bait out/dodge the W, he has nothing
- In teamfights just make sure you don't give Sett an angle to R you into your backline
   - If you E->R Sett in fights with followup, often you can 1shot him so fast they can't even press W

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is all about spacing and playing your range + autos. Shen should never be able to walk up and Q + Grasp auto you
   - His Q does give him 50 more AA range
- You can buffer E into his taunt (E). Early game if they are aggro they might taunt you, be ready to buffer E 
   - If he's close to you, buffer E backwards.
   - If he's farther away, you can buffer E at him
- Don't lead with E in trades, as he can W or E away himself.
- If you flip him, hold W for after his W. They usually will drop their zone (W) immediately
- Shen's laning power is really low. It's important you focus on wave management. 
   - You always want to SLOW PUSH, to be able to crash a big wave and deny Shen EXP/CS if he Ults away at 6

- SPAM PING THE LIVING FUCK OUT OF SHEN ULT WHEN HE HITS 6, THE ONLY THING SHEN CAN DO IS MAKE YOUR TEAM LOSE (Which is pretty big)

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Shen's Q does more damage if he drags it through your body (it also slows you if you are running away)
- Shen can nullify you in teamfights quite hard with his Ult + W + Taunt to deny your E and R

TIPS
- I like Demolish in this matchup as you can take a plate or 2 every time he Ults away
- Once you hit 9, if Shen just sits under his tower, look to proxy waves and create tempo on the map so he can't R away easily

HOW TO TRADE
- This lane is super easy. You outrange and bully Singed, ouscale him, and can even deny his Flip (E) with your own E buffer
- Watch out for 3 things:
   1) Singed E + Flash into his W ground under his tower
        - If you are careful with your autos/read his body language for when he wants to Flash, this is easily outplayable
   2) Singed getting to Proxy
        - NEVER GRIEF YOUR TEMPO, WARD THE RIVER/WRAP AROUND ENTRANCES, AND KEEP PUSHING HIM IN OR FREEZING
        - Conciously think about how Singed could potentially proxy you and look to stop it. 
        - Singed can only play the game if he can proxy, so you want to deny him the proxy AT ALL COSTS
   3) Jungle ganks
        - He has really good gank setup, so try to get deep vision out before you push Singed in
- If you don't blunder those 3 things, Singed can literally not play. Use your Range and punish/deny him off every CS With Q + PTA/Leg trades
- You can buffer his E by E'ing backwards.Uno Reverse you flip him instead
- You can buffer E while his W goo is midair, so he can't ground you from Eing

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Read the above section
- Conq Ignite Singed can be quite scary at level 6. 

TIPS
- Singed will usually have to give up EXP/CS and roam a lot in this matchup. Give your mid/bot lots of MIA pings
- If Singed is in the proxy position, it's worth giving a wave to push him out if your jungle is on your side. If you can't, look to proxy yourself if you're level 9
- You hard outscale Singed, but he provides lots of utility in teamfights even if really behind. Look to sidelane a lot, he can't really stop you from just taking the towers'

- The only interaction is trying to buffer Sion Q with E, but it's really hard as Sion can release Q at any point
   - This buffer interaction takes a lot of experience to know when to "time" your E
   - You can try to time it on the max charged Sion Q (it's always the same time), but that's risky since it will do a lot of damage + Stun you for a longer time. Generally not worth to go for
   - The closer you are to Sion the easier it is to buffer E, max range Es into his Q are much easier for him to knockdown. 
- Approach Velocity is clutch in this matchup as you can gapclose Q->E fast enough before he can charge his Q enough

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Pay attention to your minions, Sion will try to E them thru you to slow so he can trade with his Q
- Sion R can immune your R2. Generally no way around this since his ult lasts way longer than yours does, you can't just time it out

TIPS
- Try to break his shield (W) before he can activate it, then it does no damage
- You can buffer E into sion R
- You hard outscale Sion with your %HP Legs and Ult. Just make sure you don't fall behind in lane and in teamfights, he's really easy to E->R '

HOW TO TRADE
- If Skarner steps up for CS, look to Q->PTA/Leg trade.
- Maintain your spacing, don't let him Grasp auto you for free. He has no trading tools if you stand behind minions to avoid his boulder toss (Q)
- You can look to E if he enters your range, he's not that strong.
- The only thing you have to be careful for is getting R/E kidnapped into tower when your wave is near his tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Skarner R completely cancels your E, do not E if he looks to Ult
- You can E his E if you time it right before it connects
- He has insane gank setup, so care for jungle

TIPS
- Not really sure how this lane plays out (haven't seen it in a year), but it's been pretty nerfed and I can't imagine too bad
- You definitely hard outscale Skarner, so just focus on CS/farm like all tank matchups.

- Absolutely look to fight Sylas level 1, he's way weaker than you.
- Just walk up and Auto. Hold your E for his E unless he gets really close to you, then buffer E into his E2 if he recasts it
   - If not, just auto + leg and get level 2 prio
- If he takes a chunk level 1, E + Flash + W + Ignite insta kills him at level 2

HOW TO TRADE
- This is a really easy matchup, the only thing Sylas can do is max Q and farm from range
- If he ever E2's you, just buffer E into it and he gets 1shot with Ignite
- Don't E if he has E up. Just use your range, Q + Auto + PTA + Legs demolish Sylas, he's really squishy
- Sometimes Sylas will gapclose with W (it's a short dash), if you're ready you can snag them with E on this. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If he is putting points in Q, make sure you are dodging them. The delayed Q explosion does more damage, so don't get hit by that
- Be careful if he can take good ults like Swain or Alistar in teamfights

TIPS
- Sylas damage is front loaded, and he's pretty squishy if you have Ignite. Don't be afraid of continuing the fight if he gets a good initial trade
- You beat Sylas at all points during the game 1v1, and he has a hard time coming back into the game. Be aggressive and fight hard, just don't die to jungle

- Make sure to dodge Q by moving side to side after you E. If he hits Q it heals him, and this trade isn't that good
- Should always get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Stand behind minions so he can't Q you and TK can't interact with you. 
- Maintain your spacing! If he can't stack his passive on you with free Autos, you get to free scale
- If he goes for CS, look for Q->PTA/Leg trades as long as you can stand behind a minion to not get hit by his Q
- If TK jumps at you (W), BUFFER YOUR E AT HIS SHADOW ON THE GROUND. You can look to Auto, then dodge side to side for his Q as he becomes unstunned
- Post level 9, you can take extended trades with him hard, just make sure you don't get kidnapped under tower
- Watch his grey health -> shield when looking to all-in with R. 
   - Try to save your E for when hes ~40% so that even if he shields after, he'll be under the 25% R Execute range still


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- TK's only real kill angle is to Q->R kidnap you under tower.
   - If TK does land Q on you, be very careful. The slow will let him auto you -> Eat (R) you.
- Always be careful under his tower so he doesn't kidnap you. It's not worth harassing him under tower, just crash the wave and back up unless he's low.

TIPS
- You demolish TK 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver, and for the rest of the game in the 1v1. 
- TK is generally useless in teamfights compared to you unless giga fed. If you can E->R him with followup, he will usually die before he can shield or W away
- You can recast R2 from inside TK, even if he's eaten you. It is a funny interaction

- As the minions crash, take the bush. When he autos, E for shield -> Auto -> Disengage
   - If Teemo starts blind (Q), his AA dmg is weak and it's hard for him to push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke teemo out with Q until hes ~70% HP, then you can look to E + Flash + Ignite + R one shot
- If Teemo uses/wastes his blind (Q), you can look to take a heavier Q->PTA trade
   - If he has blind (Q) up, don't look to over trade
- If Teemo moves to close to you, you can look to Q->E if he's under 60-70% HP. Be careful Flipping if he's full HP, since his blind + Ignite can win an all-in before 6
- Teemo will always die if you hit Flip (E), but he's very fast with a small hitbox. Be patient, slowly Q poke him down, then E + Flash, or look to Q->E->R
   - If he wastes his blind (Q) for random poke don't be afraid to E flash all in
- Your Q is really important, use it to space/push Teemo back if he tries to trade. If you miss it Teemo can look to sprint at you and AA you down. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- If you E + Flash + R all-in when Teemo has blind (Q) up, make sure you know your lethal limits, since he can time half your ult out with Q
- Try to keep a ward in the bush closest to your tower, so you can see if he goes invisible there to cheese after the wave crashes into your tower

TIPS
- If you ever E him and he blinds you before he gets stunned, hold your W until you are unblinded
- Teemo has high auto range, so TAKE THE BUSH. 
- Rushing merc treads is strong, the extra movement speed helps with combing Q->E and tenacity reduces the blind duration
- Swap to Red trinket at 9 to clear shrooms
- Annoying champ in lane, but falls off hard. You are much stronger in sidelane/teamfights if not behind!

- Trundle is really strong lvl 1, do not fight until minions arrive.
- When the minions crash, LOOK TO JUST CHUNK: Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - Try to Flip Trundle sideways, rather than flipping him behind you. He can run you down with Ghost + Lethal Tempo + Q
   - Do not extend this trade, back off until your E is up again, then you can kill
-  Should always get level 2 prio as you are ranged

HOW TO TRADE
- Trundle is really strong in long trades with Q + Lethal Tempo, but has low range
- Gameplan: Use our RANGE ADVANTAGE to chunk him to 60%HP before looking to oneshot with Ignite + R
   - If he walks up for CS, Q->PTA/Leg trade then disengage
   - Never E aggressively pre-9 unless he's chunked and you're intending to all-in with Ignite + R
- Play around your Q: if Trundle tries to walk at you with W MS, use your Q + range to push him back
- If you don't want to fight and he Pillars (E) you, click to the side of it and E away 
   - Make sure you don't E into the pillar
- Trundle clears minions really slow, so slow pushing big waves (stuck under tower farming, big waves helps deter his all-in) OR freezing (free poke) are strong strategies
- Post-9, if you fight, look to get the jump on him with your Q + Range
   - Save E > R combo for when he's ~60-70% HP. 
       - Ult won't time out
       - If you insta E, they may insta R, making the 1v1 hard
       - If they hold R, you can 1shot him in the E flip depending on your items

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Trundle can cancel your E with his pillar (E) if timed well. 
- Trundle's level 6 is extremely strong 1v1, be very respectful especially if he has ghost + the long lane


TIPS
- Don't go Tank build vs Trundle, you need to be able to 1v1 him and push out the sidelanes
- Trundle will only play to split push. Make sure you don't abandon your sidelanes, and kill him/push sidelane out before grouping
- Trundle is a champ that is made for 1v1, but is weak 5v5. That being said you win 1v1 after 9/Black Cleaver if you play well
   - If you have enough damage, Trundle gets one shot in your E flip before he can Ult/ramp up'

   - Hold your E, just use your autos. If he spins on you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
   - If he doesn't spin, push him off CS with your legs/range and get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- You can play really aggressive in this matchup with PTA + Ignite pre-6, but after 6 you have to play a lot more respectful. 
-  His R/sustain counter you from lvl 6-9 just let the wave push into you and farm. They usually hit it a lot to stack fury
- If the wave is pushing out, slow push and build big waves. Stand in front of your minions and try to auto, so he can't stack fury, and hope the wave crashes
- Trade based around his fury:
   - If he has low fury, look to be aggressive and use your Range + Legs to push him off so he can't auto for fury
   - If he has high fury, you have to respect AND HOLD YOUR Q. If he spins on you, use your Q to slow and make space. You don't want to E here or he can run you down/dive you
- Never E forwards if he has ult, high fury, or full HP. Also keep in mind he can E to dodge your E
- HOW TO PLAY THE ALL-IN/DIVE:
   - We want to use the FULL 4s of our R slow + R pull animation to time out his ult
   - Make sure you R him at ~200HP. If R base damage can "kill" Trynda (even if he's in R) it will AUTO PULL. THAT IS BAD.
   - As he dives,  once he's lower: R -> E/Auto to force his R -> Run and let R2 auto time out after 4s -> Pull him in + Ignite -> Hope his R is over
       - Usually Tryndamere will have ~0.5-1s of Ult left, so hit him with an auto and Ignite 
       - MAKE SURE YOU IGNITE AT THE END OF THE FIGHT SO ITS NOT WASTED IN HIS R


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be very careful in the long lane, they will always look to run you down with W slow + Ghost + Lethal Tempo
- Tryndamere has INFINITE SUSTAIN and is hard to all-in because of R. Don't overtrade/OOM yourself with Q/E, just use your Range + Autos
- Tryndamere W is "castable" without needing vision of you. He can tell if you're cheesing in a bush

TIPS
- Try to get Plated Steelcaps first base
- After 9/Black Cleaver you hard outscale for the rest of the game
   - You hard outscale Tryndamere because later on, you do so much damage you force his R in your E flip alone
   - Then you can kite him out easily. You won't kill, but Tryndamere without R IS NOT A CHAMP.'

- He's really squishy, so if you can trade level 1 he gets oneshot at level 2 with E + F + Ignite + W
- Hard to get prio due to his range, take the bushes and try to match his push 

HOW TO TRADE
- Gameplan is to poke TF out with Q+Leg Autos until we can E + Flash + R + Ignite at 70%HP
- If he has his card up (W), don't auto, just Q. If he's used it then you can go for a Q -> PTA trade
- Always try to take control of the bush so he can't auto you for free
- Early game his range and damage are quite oppressive, you don't need to force trades. 
    - Level 6 this matchup gets much easier because of your R
- You can buffer E through his gold card, but it still outranges so you won't Flip
   - UNLESS you have a lot of MS, then you can Q->E, but make sure to get really close after Qing and buffer E just as the gold card hits


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-  His damage comes from his E proc, pay attention to when it's up
- Be careful of the Red Card splash damage around minions
- TF has INSANE ROAMS/GANKS with Ghost, his Ult, and Gold card. Really make sure to ping your team so they respect his ganking power

TIPS
- TF is a very summ (ghost/flash) reliant champ, look to punish when they are down (esp if you have Flash up)
- No one really plays AD TF top anymore, but his scaling is still strong if he doesn't fall behind. As long as you hit E + Flash he insta dies though

- Take bush and try your best to match his push, his range gives him level 2 prio usually

HOW TO TRADE
- Really difficult matchup, Varus's base damage is so high he kind of stat checks you at all points
- If he has Bone Plating, PTA, Barrier it's really difficult as he can fight you early with this setup. Try to get behind him and if you can hit E with Ignite you can still win.
- If he has no barrier, you can 1-shot him with E flash at all points.
- Just look for Q poke when you can and avoid getting into his Auto range
- Rush Dirk for the dirk level 6 Ignite powerspike, so you can oneshot from 80/90% HP.
- If  he messes up spacing and you can gapclose with Q->E, look for that. If he doesn't, really important you don't waste Flash as you need it to one shot. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
-If you can't manage to get leads on him early, it's really important you respect his level up timers/range. He deals a ton of damage from a long range, and if you take one bad trade it's hard to overcome that HP difference in an all-in. 

TIPS
- You can buffer your E away if he tries to R you
- You don't outscale Varus, but you can always one shot him if you go damage build.

- DO NOT PUSH IN THIS MATCHUP EARLY, LET HER PUSH YOU IN.  You cannot crash the wave if you try to push

HOW TO TRADE
- Goal is to poke her to 75% with Q, then look for E + Flash + R oneshot
- When Vayne Qs forward, look to trade with Q+PTA
- If you Q first, Vayne can tumble over your Q and take a good trade
- Save your E + Flash for AFTER she tumbles, or she can dodge it
- If you ever hit E, vayne dies, but you can usually only hit with Flash. If you have enough MS, you can Q->E if she tumbles forward. 
- Do not even try to kill her/trade if your Flash is down, just preserve HP and farm

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- YOU CANNOT KILL VAYNE WITHOUT FLASH. You cannot make a mistake in this lane, and you cannot waste Flash
- Really good Vayne's can buffer condemn (E) into your E + Flash. Don't worry about this too much

TIPS
- Edge of Night first is very good into Vayne, as she can only pop it with her E and if her E is on cd you can run her down
- Vayne scales very hard and has no room for mistakes, even from behind she will be trouble. It just comes down to whether you can land the E on her or not.
    - That being said Vayne top makes the enemy team's comp very bad so you will be more useful in teamfights if she's not fed'

- Level 1 look to get behind him and get aggro, E forwards and just auto. 
- Look to disengage after he backs off before his Q comes up again if he's not in lethal range to ignite

HOW TO TRADE
- Wincons in this lane:
    - Constant pressure on Vlad with Q -> leg + auto, especially when his Q is on CD (you can see it's CD from his resource bar), to not let him slowly outsustain you with his healing
    - Not letting him empowered Q you
    - Killing with E flash before he can pool
- If you let Vlad play the slow game and push you in/slowly chip at your HP with Q you will be pushed out of lane and outscaled
- Early on try to test how good his reactions are by Eing at him.
    - Pretend you are disengaging and walk backwards after a Q auto trade, he will walk forwards as you walk back, then E him
    - Against competent Vladimirs though, you will only ever be able to E him before he pools with E + Flash (if the Vladimir is good enough to pool this its gg for you)
- At 70%, look for E + Flash + Ignite + R.
    - Even if he is able to cast pool after your E stun wears off, Ignite will tick him down and you can execute when he resurfaces from W

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful not to R2 during his pool animation, as it can block R2

TIPS
- Vladimir likes to run straight at you when he gets his empowered Q ms, this is an easy timing to Q poke him 
- If you haven't found leads early game, just focus on farming until 9. At 9 you have the DPS to E to gapclose and stick on Vlad with Q slow

    - Use this trade and your range advantage to secure level 2 prio
    - Do not let him auto the wave for free level 1 or he can stack his passive

HOW TO TRADE
- After level 3+ do not interact and just farm until 9, Volibear is a huge lane bully that omega statchecks you. 
    - If you take one bad trade he can easily dive you with his R
-  Let the wave push in you and farm. Thankfully Volibears usually auto pushes to stack his passive
- If he runs at you with Q, try to Q + W to proc phase rush to run away
    - If it's not enough, just buffer E away before it connects
       - But without E he might look to dive you
    - Unless you can flip him into tower range, NEVER E FORWARDS UNTIL 9
- Use Phase Rush to kite/trade with him. If he lands Q + E you lose half your HP

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Make sure to wait for his W mark to time out, getting hit by one second W is lane ending

TIPS
- You need 1st item + executioners if you don't have Ignite to even think about fighting back
- You can win 1v1 at 9+ with Black Cleaver/Executioners, and you hard outscale as the game goes on

- Level 1 most Warwicks will try to walk up and Q you. Auto -> E -> Auto and they will be half HP and forced to concede prio.

HOW TO TRADE
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in Autos/Legs without letting him Q
- Your autos barely outrange his Q, so spacing is very important as if he trade autos/Q you lose out eventually
- USE YOUR RANGE, PUSH HIM IN, POKE HIM, BUT DO NOT LET HIM Q YOU! You have to space
- If he walks up to CS, Q->PTA/Leg combo 
- You can use your E to small trade, try to flip him sideways rather than behind you.
   - Make space after you Flip so he can't Q easily

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Be careful if he does choose to fight you, trading perma without having lethal is good for Warwick - being half HP or below is Warwick's win con
    - Even if it looks like it's going well at the start Warwick wins lane by being unkillable below 25% HP and then just outsustains you
- DON'T GET BAITED. Warwick wants to be low so he gets more damage + healing, and all his healing/tankiness is backloaded with his R/E
    - Also factor in his BARRIER + E
- Be careful of Warwick getting movement speed in lane early due to your team being low on the map

TIPS
- Get Executioner's first base, even if you have Ignite
- Playing this lane is all about sneaking in autos without letting him Q onto you. They barely outrange his Q so spacing is very important as if he can get melee range onto you with this scaling setup you will lose
- You hard outscale at 9/1st item and executioners. He's turbo useless in teamfights and his wincon is cheesing lane to get fed'

- You can look to do a small E trade early. If he E's you, Auto -> E -> Auto Auto PTA -> Disengage
- Do not prolong the fight, he wins with max Passive + Conq stacks

HOW TO TRADE
- The wincon for Urgot in this matchup is being tanky/healthy enough to hold E until after Wukong W clones during his all ins level 6-8
- Very important to not waste E or panic E if he engages on you, as he can just W clone to dodge it. 
- You need to be very patient and hold your E, Wukong usually has W for dmg: R -> W after knockup ends -> R to have enough damage to kill you
    - If you still have your E up you can threaten E flash ignite R one shot even if you're much lower
    - If you're confident, you can immediately E into his E. If you're fast with it, you can catch him in the E animation before he clones. This is generally risky though so best done later in the game/under your tower

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Wukong's Q range scales with Q level, and is about the same as your auto range at 9. His main poking pattern in lane is E minion -> Q so watch for this to not get poked down

TIPS
- Ignite early in fights so you cut his conq/passive healing immediately and don't risk igniting his clone
- You can always tell if you E Wukong or his clone, Eing the clone will have a weird "stop" animation and it wont be a fluid E. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN USE R IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FLIP OR NOT
- Outscale at 9/1st item
    - Keep in mind though that Wukong's main strength is his teamfighting, always try to mark him to watch flanks'

- If he's E start, he'll dash thru minions. Once you're in range and he wants to dash thru you, E BEHIND YOURSELF

HOW TO TRADE
- Yasuo is a hard matchup as he has infinite dashes to dodge your E, Windwall blocks Q R1 and R2, and shield to win short trades as well while also winning long trades pre-9
- Winning this matchup comes down to being patient with your E, if you hit E you win. 
    - Be aware of your minions to see where he could possibly dash to, try to predict your E to knock him down
    - If you waste your E and he dodges it by dashing through minions you will get run down and die
- Look for E + Flash + R one shot when he's at 60%. 
    - He has to be a little lower than other champs because his windwall will instantly cut off all your damage once he gets unstunned.
- Just let him push you in and farm until you're 9, they usually hit the wave to stack Q


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- His windwall will also block your R2 recast, so don't spam R2 unless you can execute him while he's stunned. Try to walk around it so it's not in between you and Yasuo if you can
- Buffering E into his Q3 -> R is really hard. If he tornados you, don't bother buffering E, save it until after his R

TIPS
- Try to take his passive with your leg splash damage
- The 1v1 just comes down to who plays it better/if you hit E post 9

- Should get level 2 prio

HOW TO TRADE
- Trades are based around Yone W. Try to bait it out, then look for Q->PTA trades
- Never E Yone if he has E up. You want to buffer E when he Q3's forward
   - Be careful as Yone max range Q3 gives him enough space to click back and dodge Urgot E
- If Yone E > Q3s, just E to force his E snapback, or else he can take a beefy trade. 
   - In general, you never really have windows to E yone unless his E is on CD
- Look to E + Flash + R Yone at 70% HP. 
   - If he has E up to dodge your E FLash,  to make it less obvious, Q/Auto trade -> pretend to run away -> E + Flash when he rechases
- Urgot can buffer Yone R by E'ing BACKWARDS

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Until 9, Yone generally has stronger short trades with W, and long trades with lethal tempo. You can't force trades on him
   - Focusing on farming/going even until then is smart
- Be careful on wasting your E, it's really easy for Yone to re-engage with Q3/E and run you down

TIPS
- You smoke Yone after 9/Black Cleaver. I like going a lethality build after that since Yone is a hard scaling tank shredder, he gets one tapped

HOW TO TRADE
- EXTREMELY LOW INTERACTION MATCHUP, Yorick just pushes you in post 6 with his infinite ghoul army
    - Sit under tower and farm
- This matchup comes down to sidestepping his E, it's his only ranged tool
    - The hitbox of it grows larger if you try to dodge backwards, but its quite narrow on the sides, so dodge it by side stepping side to side
    - When it's on cooldown you can Q->PTA trade as his ghouls won't auto target you
    - Play at his E max range so if it hits you, you have time to E away before he can cage you
- If he W cages you, your W won't target the cage unless there is absolutely nothing else to hit
    - Don't W and manually auto the cage to get out
- Post 6 it's heavily Yorick favored once he has his maiden, but can look to fight if it dies
- Fortunately Yorick auto pushes the lane with his maidens/ghouls so you can just scale for free
- If he somehow is <60% HP, you can look to E + Flash + R

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Yorick Cage can knockdown and cancel your E.
- You no longer one shot his ghouls
- His Q heals for %missing HP, don't get baited thinking he's low, especially if you have no antiheal

HOW TO TRADE

- Zac has infinite sustain, so we must use our range to trade
    - Q + PTA if he walks up for CS
    - Don't take mindless trades where he can W/auto, he will out sustain you easily. 
- If he E jumps you look to buffer your E on the shadow, then sidestep the followup Q he will throw at you in a straight line
- If played properly, this is mainly a farming lane. Slow push big waves and try to build a CS lead. Zac is quite hard to kill if he doesn't want to die and they almost always will play passive to scale

- Make sure you can insta kill if you flash before he Ults, the knockup and heal buy a lot of time

- Once Aatrox gets Plated Steelcaps, the MS + armor make it extremely hard to trade back
   - Try to fight hard first 3 levels, if he's not behind and TPs back with Steelcaps it's cooked
- Ignite (or anti-heal) is mandatory if you try to kill him. Have to know lethal limits well in this matchup, as he can heal with Passive + Q above 25% if you try to E flash him

TIPS
- You can "ride" Aatrox W pull by buffering E. Useful in catching them off guard if they're prepping W -> Q under your tower for instance
- You hard outscale after 9/Black Cleaver

Quick Summary:
- Wincon is dodging his Q and chunk him to 70% HP, then look for E + Flash all in 

- Play aggro lvl 1-3

- Play around his Q CD to trade

- Flip on his Q2 + E

- Try your best to go even lvl 3-8, he's really strong with Plated Steelcaps

- Hard outscale 1v1 after lvl 9

Detailed Guide:
EARLY GAME
- Get behind Aatrox and look to fight level 1.
    - Try to bait out the Q1 by spacing max range
    - Walk closer and Auto + E in his Q2 animation (Need to be inner edge of Q2)
    - If you FLIP, click away from Q3 and trade autos/PTA

HOW TO TRADE:
- It's all about spacing and playing around his Q. 
- Goal is to trade with Q/Autos/PTA when his Q is on CD. Repeat until hes ~70%, and you can look for E + Flash + Ignite + R kill.

- You cannot flip Aatrox in Q1 + E, it's too long. Look to FLIP on his Q2 + E
    - Aatrox Q1 + Es forward, sidestep side to side 
    - Q2, click away, then click towards him to try to get him to Q2 + E FORWARDS. This is where you try to FLIP him.
    - Make space so he can't Q3 you after FLIPPING

- This lane is really hard if you can't find leads pre-6/first base, as he can slowly poke you down at range with Q1 + E forever. 
- Only look to E if his E is on cooldown


WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR
- Q1 damage is hard to avoid, but does minimal damage. Getting hit by Q2 is a lot more damage, so be careful with spacing/buffering E into Q2
